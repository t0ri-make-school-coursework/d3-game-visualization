            "Description": "Divinity: Original Sin is a role-playing game that harks backs to an earlier generation of the genre using an isometric view, turn-based combat, extensive crafting options, a complex story with variable dialogue, and a focus on systems in the game world for the player to shape instead of scripting the experience. Set in the Rivellon world, Original Sin takes place 12 centuries before Divine Divinity, the first game in the saga, and thousands years after Divinity: Dragon Commander.Many centuries ago, a powerful magic called The Source was used to heal people and make good, but it happened that The Source became tainted, and the Sourcerers started to use The Source to hurt and destroy. The Council of Seven, the rulers of Rivellon, outlawed usage of The Source and send Source Hunters to investigate each time Source usage is suspected, and to eliminate the menace. You play two Source-Hunters sent by the Council to the city of Cyseal, where Councillor Jake was murdered.While you can play alone and control the two characters and their companions, the game is made with cooperative gaming for two players in mind. The dialog options you choose, and the actions you make modify your reputation, and therefore, affects how people will react. Combat in the game is turn-based, with action points, spells combos, and friendly fire.",

Before taking his last breath, the man gave Alex a piece of a map and a medallion made of Sun Stone.There are eleven locations in which Alex must explore, each of them has its own unique dangers. In each location, Alex can collect bags of coins, which can be used to buy items at the shop and are used to help Alex get through each location (eg: motorcycle, peticopter, power bracelet, etc.) There are also traps that Alex must avoid like the ghost that chases him. He can also collect the Telepathy Ball that will help him read people's minds.Later, Alex learns that in order to save Radactian from destruction, he must first defeat Janken the Great, Emperor of the planet Janbarik (he got his name from his expertise at the game of Janken -- or what people call \"scissors, paper, stone\" in the Western World. Janken has sent his henceman all over Radactian to prepare the game for Alex as he passes by them. In order to get past them, Alex must win three times at Janken. If he loses, he is turned to stone and vanished from Radactian forever. Later on in the game, Alex must play with the same henceman, but only this time, when Alex wins, they decide to play dirty.Alex uses his fists to wipe out some of Janken's enemies such as birds, sea horses, bats, monkeys, frogs, and a few others. If his quest to save Radactian from the evil hands of Janken becomes difficult, he can instead use the power bracelet to perform the \"Shocking Waves of Destruction\", an ancient trick in the art of Shellcore.Before Alex comes face-to-face with Janken, he should rescue his brother, Egle, from imprisonment, and get the letter and two medallions.\n",

            "Description": "Aliens Versus Predator is a sci-fi first-person shooter based on the associated two film franchises. The game has three playable species, and each has its own single-player campaign with different missions and plotlines.\n\nAliens... Their only weapons are their own body parts: claws for close combat, their deadly tail, and their inner mouth that can crack through an enemy's skull (for an instant kill) if close enough. They are deadly at close range, and can heal by eating corpses or the heads of unsuspecting enemies. They can't be hurt through falls, and an alternate vision mode allows them to see clearly ahead through darkness. Their strength lies in flexibility and speed, and an ability to cling to walls and run along any surface - allowing a skilled player to escape or ambush from literally any 3D direction.\nHumans... U.S. Marines, as portrayed by Michael Biehn in the film 'Aliens'. Marines have strong firepower that ranges from the self-tracking SmartGun, all the way to rocket launchers and devistating six-barrel miniguns (as seen in 'Predator'). The Marines are the most familiar species to play as, with the gameplay style of typical FPS hero. However, their frailty at close range, and missions that leave them stranded, alone, surrounded by bloodthirsty extraterrestrials, make their experience closer to survival horror.\nPredators... Their power is their strength, and their sight. They have at least four ways of seeing the environment - standard vision, heat vision (highlighting Marines), electromagnetic vision (highlighting Aliens), and \"Pred-Tech\" (for highlighting fellow Predators and their technology).  Their weapons are the most precise, deadly, and ranged of those in the game, being ideally suited to stealth-based gameplay. Predators also have the ability to zoom their view in and out when seeking someone, thus allowing them to snipe from afar. Their cloaking ability also renders them nearly invisible to enemy Marines.\n\nThere are several multiplayer modes. For a difficult game, you can pit all the players against the horde of computer creatures (which includes experimental robotic Aliens and tough Predalien hybrids). Alternatively, players can choose their favorite species and face each other in an arena-style deathmatch.",

To avoid this, the president comes up with a plan to stop the disaster - but before applying it, the long-term impacts on the world need to be validated. This is done with a simulation visited by the computer project PRISM, designed to be a true AI. The game starts when PRISM awakes from a simulation of his own, human life and is told that he is in fact the world's first sentient machine. At this point, the player takes control over PRISM.A Mind Forever Voyaging is a text-based interactive fiction game. The player reads descriptions which detail the surroundings and communicates with the game by typing in commands. Most of the time is spent in simulation mode where the player repeatedly visits the town of Rockvil and needs to record situations of everyday or special activities going on. If the player has recorded enough, the game progresses and the simulation ten years ahead can be visited. However, the recording device has no unlimited capacity - when full, the player needs to exit the simulation and let the recordings review by the project leader. Then the current simulation can be simply started again from the start to find new situations - the same applies when dying.Between simulations and toward the end there are situations outside the simulation, but overall the game is light on puzzle-solving and more about experiencing how said plan changes Rockvil and its people over time. Outside the simulation there are three more modes to enter: communications (switching to various video/audio units to examine other locations and people), library (various documents and other information to read) and interlace (communicating and giving orders to the own subsystems).",

Since men cannot survive on the surface, the task of collecting the crystals is assigned to a cyborg.You take control of the cyborg and must collect different types of crystals in a number of side-scrolling levels, while fighting off mutated animals. Your cyborg can jump, shoot and use smart bombs that damage everything on screen. From time to time, extras appear that replenish some of your health or improve your weapon. If your weapon is at maximum power, you can also collect additional smart bombs.

Green crystal teleport you to the other end of a level. Red crystals take you to another level and blue crystals are needed to get to another continent.

            "Description": "Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard &amp; the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.Archon can be played with either one or two players.\nThe NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.",

It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.",

            "Description": "Armadillo Run is a physics-based puzzle game that requires player to move an armadillo (pictured as a simple ball) to the blue area and hold it there for five seconds. To achieve that goal player is given resources represented by various building materials: Rope, Cloth, Metal bar, Metal sheet, Elastic rope, Rubber and Rockets. Those items must be used to create a certain structure to guide armadillo to the blue zone. The game is similar to Pontifex  series in a sense that each material has its own set of properties. So not only material's functionality must be taken into account, but it's durability as well. Incorrectly built structures have all chances to collapse under their own weight. Other properties include: stretching,  flexibility, tensile strength and compressive strength. Player is limited to the amount of materials he can use by the budget. The less number of items the player uses in solving the puzzle the less amount of money will be withdrawn from his account, consequently giving player a higher budget for the levels to come. Apart from using materials the game offers different editing modes that are designed to help player in his progress. They include: Structural, Tension and Timer. Structural mode allows player to place new links in the game area, thus creating new structures. Tension is used to adjust the starting tension/compression of the links. And Timer will make a certain link self-destruct after a pre-set period of time. The game plays much like The Incredible Machine series challenging the player with the progression of levels, each becoming available once the requirement of the previous one was met. The difficulty is growing up with the level number as well. The total number of levels is 50. However, since the time of the game's release, countless enthusiasts have created their own custom levels available for download at Armadillo Run official website. ",

The game starts when junior constable Cactus responds to a distress call sent three days before. When closing in, the weapon systems are suddenly activated and she boards the ship. She meets three fellow androids (Holly, Lemon and Coral) who tell her the entire robot force has started an uprising. To end it the Nexus Core needs to be brought back online so the four robot masters, the Section Lords, return to their normal state.The game takes place in dynamic arenas where just one, or up to four androids, can can work together cooperatively to clear sections to get closer to the Nexus Core. The main campaign consists of 25 stages divided into five zones. Each zone has a large boss battle at the end. The androids always face a huge resistance in waves and regularly have to fight 25 to 50 enemies at a single time. The android can be freely move around the environment and has access to a primary and a secondary weapon. The primary weapon has an unlimited amount of ammo, while the secondary and more powerful one needs some time to cool down. The key to switch between weapons also has a short dodge functionality. Defeated enemies release energy that can be collected to power up the primary weapon. Defeated enemies often leave behind power-ups such as additional firepower, faster speed, a shutdown that freezes all enemies and more.There is no regular health system. Instead, an android has a battery that drains at a constant rate. The android cannot constantly move backwards or circle while firing, as enemies regularly leave behind batteries needed to recharge, so often it is necessary to venture inside groups of enemies to retrieve it. When the battery loses all power the game is over. Taking damage can cause a temporary knock down and all power-ups for the primary weapon are lost, but the android comes back as long as there is battery energy remaining. Initially four androids are available, but eventually a total of nine can be unlocked. They all behave and control in the same way, but differ in weapons. There are regular guns, shotguns, a permanent beam, a railgun, a spinning disc etc. offering different play styles. The secondary weapons are also very different, deploying mines, rushing through groups with a drill, activating a flame thrower and so on.Enemies consist of spider-like robots, giants that launch mines, small robots that can trap android with a beam etc. with different firing patterns. Many levels have interactive elements causing the walls to change regularly or influencing movement or visibility. Some levels have turrets that can be activated to provide firing assistance. Completing areas is rewarded with credits that are used to unlock EX options, modifiers for the game, such as AI partners, psychedelic visuals or a first-person perspective. Players can also unlock sounds tests, music tracks and codex entries with information about characters, enemies and the game world. Additional unlockable game modes are the endless Infinity Drive, the Daily Drive with a new challenge each day, and a Boss Rush.",

You play as the young, boylike robot Astro Boy, a true mechanical pacifist who's biggest dream is that one day humans and robots can coexist in peace. Armed with a strong punch, rocket powered feet and the ability to shoot laserbeams from your fingers, arms and behind, you set off on a quest against all sorts of evildoers from the Astro Boy series.The game has two distinctive types of levels: the more prevalent beat-em-up levels and the shooter-esque levels. During the beat-em-up levels you can walk around freely and your flying ability is limited to short bursts. The shooter levels differ from each other: sometimes you can float around the screen and shoot in both directions, other times you are flying in a set direction in a more on-the-rails fashion.The Omega Factor mentioned in the title is actually a simple upgrading system for your weapons. Every time Astro meets someone new (be they good or bad) he or she will be added to the Omega factor screen and Astro can upgrade one of his six weapons or abilities.",

Two young mecha pilots, Riki and his sister Mami, board a giant mecha called Bangai-O, in order to confront the pirates in battle and foil their villainous plans.Bangai-O is a multi-directional shooter and a spiritual successor to Hover Attack. The player manoeuvres the titular mecha and shoots in eight directions. Two firing modes represent switching between the two pilots. Riki fires homing missiles, while Mami's shots bounce off walls. Enemies drop fruits upon defeat, which are equivalent to power-ups in other games. It is also possible to execute a special attack that consists of a burst of shots fired in all directions. Scoring successful combos (or increasing explosion count in the Dreamcast version) leads to higher-level power-ups. ",

The bank has 12 doors in front of 12 teller windows, with only three doors visible at a time. Shooting is done simply by pressing one of the three buttons to shoot the left, middle or right door. The player can move his viewpoint left and right to reveal new doors. People only appear behind the doors that are currently visible on screen, except for the rare outlaws who will pop up to steal a cash deposit from a teller window the player isn't watching. Indicators at the top of the screen show how much time it will take before someone will show up at a door. If a bandit appears behind a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot him before he shoots you. If you shoot him too early (i.e. before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair and gives very little score, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. Sometimes a bandit will stick dynamite on one of the doors. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you take too long, the bomb explodes (even if it's offscreen) and you lose a life. If you're lucky, a customer will appear behind the door and deposit a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. Sometimes a bandit will suddenly take the customer hostage and replace them in the door. At other times, a cowboy will appear with a stack of hats. Shooting off all the hats before the door closes grants a cash deposit and a big score bonus. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins. There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, there is a time limit.",

All of the friends have been imprisoned, except for Hatty Hattington who has become the leader of the island's feline population. The levels of the game are presented as challenges set in a theater show for the cats' amusement. The story is furthered through cut-scenes in stick puppet style and through a narrator.The player's character can move around, jump and attack. It is also possible to climb pipes, do wall jumps and double jumps. While combat with punches, kicks, weapons and special attacks can dispose of enemies, the focus is largely on the platforming. The game consists of eight worlds each with their own theme and split up into different stages. As the title implies, every part of the environment is built up out of blocks. These have different properties, causing them to disappear, become slippery with ice, and there are also conveyor belts, exploding platforms, portals, catapults, elevators etc. There are also hazards such as lasers, saw blades, spikes, traps and enemies. The gameplay combines Super Meat Boy challenging navigation with little room for error with environments that contain small puzzle elements at a slower pace. Puzzles often involve pushing blocks to influence the environment. Levels have checkpoints where the character respawns after dying.300 new characters (prisoner friends) can be unlocked by collecting gems. Each character has a slight variation in movement and abilities. Three gems are required to complete a level, but there are always many more to be found. Each level also has a hidden yarn ball used as a currency to bribe guards for improved weapons.Next to the main campaign there are 24 bonus stages (three per world). The player is also rewarded with a medal for a fast time (as well as an additional gem) and can locate hidden collectibles. The game includes a level editor to create and edit levels, and share them afterwards. Cooperative and competitive multiplayer is supported both offline and online. There are various game modes with King of the Hill or involving basketball.",

            "Description": "Battlefield: Bad Company is a war-themed first person shooter and the second in the series developed exclusively for the console platforms. The title refers to a a group of the 222nd Army battalion of soldiers considered hard to steer and incompetent troublemakers. As such, they do not receive much respect in battle and squad of four decides to desert to pursue their own goals. The war takes places in fictional countries in the Middle East and the US squad takes on Russians, soldiers of the Middle East coalition and Legionnaire mercenaries. The player controls protagonist Preston Marlowe. His squad members are Terrence Sweetwater, George Gordon Haggard Jr. and the leader Samuel Redford.Marlowe has a health injector he can use as many times as he desires to restore his health. When dying, he also respawns immediately at the last location. Players can only carry a maximum of four weapons at any given time. There are many vehicles to drive, such as hummers, buggies, boats, tanks, boats and even helicopters to control. The storyline takes the characters through different fictional countries with mission where their background and motivation is gradually revealed.The new Frostbite DX engine makes it possible to destroy many objects and buildings, almost to completely demolishing them. This changes the way the environment can be used as a cover, as everything can be destroyed. The multiplayer portion features games with a ranking system where items and weapons are gradually unlocked. The base game includes only one mode, Gold Rush, with teams of attackers and defenders.Through five events such as describing to the newsletter, pre-ordering the game or reaching a certain rank in the demo, players could receive player codes to unlock five new weapons: F2000 assault rifle, USAS-12 semi-automatic shotgun, M60 light machine gun, QBU-88 sniper rifle and the silenced UZI submachine gun.",

They believe in the evolution of man through machine by cybernetic implants. You are one of the unlucky victims: a prisoner in a Mondite complex on a distant moon, with no memory of your former life. Your body has been turned into a hideous cybernetic nightmare by the evil Dr. Mastaba. It is up to you to explore the complex (abandoned and on the verge of nuclear meltdown), discover the secrets of the Mondites and the mysterious remnants of alien civilization they've discovered, and get out alive from this moon. BioForge is an action game with puzzle-solving, technologically similar to Alone in the Dark, featuring polygonal (and textured) characters over pre-rendered backgrounds. The adventure elements involve the hero collecting items and figuring out puzzles in order to get to new places and discover the secrets of the complex. The action elements involve combat against foes robotic and alive, both with melee weaponry and with guns, though some enemies require trickery rather than force to defeat. Numerous journals, documents and diaries are found throughout the game; these are all recorded and can be re-read at any time. ",

            "Description": "In the year 1960 a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a man named Jack as the only survivor. He has the apparent luck of resurfacing in front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating, Jack enters the door and is greeted by slogans that praise the city of Rapture, a paradise of free will built in the 1940's by a business magnate named Andrew Ryan. However, even before he assimilates all this new information, the descent to this supposed paradise ends and he can only see ruins and chaos. Learning about the destiny of Rapture will be now Jack's main motivation while he tries to survive the horrors that the free will can create.BioShock is a first-person shooter with gameplay elements and storytelling technique reminiscent of System Shock games. Rapture, the once proud social experiment inspired by the real-world objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand, has been nearly destroyed, its inhabitants either dead or fallen victims to bizarre scientific experiments. The retro-futuristic setting incorporates elements of sci-fi with art deco and steampunk influences, featuring interior design and propaganda posters reminiscent of 1950's.The game's plot is largely revealed through recorded messages left by Rapture's inhabitants before they were killed or mutated. Much of the plot development is therefore dedicated to reconstructing the events of the past, similarly to System Shock games. Limited usage of stealth, the possibility to hack security cameras and other devices, and character customization are the gameplay elements that further tie BioShock to its spiritual predecessors.In its core, however, the game is more action-oriented, restricting the role-playing mechanics of System Shock 2 to abilities and upgrades that can be acquired and equipped by the main character. Most of the enemies in the game are Splicers, the deformed and insane citizens of Rapture. The protagonist has an arsenal of firearms to combat them, but is also able to use plasmids, which act similarly to magic and deplete a special energy called EVE. Various types of plasmids may directly hurt enemies, sabotage their movements, or enhance the player character's defense. Combat tactics often rely on successive usage of different types of weapons and plasmids. For example, encasing an enemy in ice with a plasmid makes it possible to shatter it to pieces with a single shot; protecting himself with an electric shield, the protagonist can electrocute enemies and strike them with melee weapons, etc.The player can only equip a limited number of active and passive plasmids, and also has an inventory limit for every type of item. Restoring and enhancing items can be found by exploring the environment or purchased from vending machines. These can also be hacked, similarly to turrets, cameras, safes, and other types of locks. Hacking is presented as a Pipe Mania-like mini-game.Plasmids, on the other hand, are mostly purchased by spending certain amounts of a mutagen known as ADAM. This mutagen can be obtained from mysterious creatures called \"Little Sisters\" - little girls that can be seen in most of the game's locations, accompanied and protected by very strong, genetically enhanced humans grafted to armored diving suits and nicknamed \"Big Daddies\". In order to capture a Little Sister the player normally has to defeat her Big Daddy. Afterwards, the player has the choice of killing the girl, harvesting large amounts of ADAM in process, or sparing her life. Depending on the player's moral decisions concerning the Little Sisters, the game's story will be concluded with different endings.The Playstation 3 version adds a harder difficulty level called \"Survivor Mode\" to the game.",

            "Description": "Ten years have passed since the events in BioShock. The underwater-city Rapture has further deteriorated, with water breaking in everywhere and whole sections flooded by water. But as bad as the situation is, the city still isn’t empty. After Andrew Ryan’s death, his long adversary, the psychiatrist Dr. Sophia Lamb took over the helm – embracing her own cult, making the mutated splicers that roam the city her worshippers. In the middle is Delta, the first of the protectors of the Little Sisters better known as Big Daddies. Eternally bonded to one and only one Little Sister called Eleanor, daughter of Sophia Lamb, he’s damned to search the city and find her or die trying.The player slips into the mighty boots of Delta, making his way in a typical first-person-shooter-style through the city of Rapture to find and confront Dr. Sophia Lamb, who holds Eleanor against her will. The switch of perspective, in the first game the player was a normal human, also brings with it a few changes in gameplay. The most important being, that the player can now use both one of the eleven available plasmids and one of the several different weapons at the same time, allowing him to burn enemies while pumping them full of bullets. Other plasmids include “Winter Blast” which freezes an enemy or “Scout” which allows the player to leave his body and look around unnoticed. The weapons on the hand range from the famous Big-Daddy-Drill over a powerful double-barrel-shotgun to a grenade launcher.As in the first game, both weapons and plasmids are upgradeable. While the weapons just require the player to find a special workstation, upgrades for plasmids and tonics (granting passive effects) are bought at special vending machines called “Gatherer’s Garden” with the rare substance called “Adam”. As in the first game, the Little Sisters roaming the levels are the key to getting access to Adam. But since the player himself is a Big Daddy, the process is a bit different this time around. While the player still needs to kill the accompanying Big Daddy to get access to the Little Sister, he can choose to adopt it afterwards instead of just harvesting it. The Little Sister will then sit on his shoulder and look for Adam-infused bodies in the level to harvest them.Setting down a Little Sister to harvest a body will unleash hell as every splicer in the level will try to kill her, requiring the player to protect the little girl from harm until its finished collecting. Once a Little Sister has harvested two bodies, the player can again either harvest her himself, or free her. Either action grants him more or less Adam and at the same time may alert a Big Sister. As opposed to the Big Daddies, they are nimble, fast and very deadly.Another important change is the new hacking-mini-game which is the same in all versions now and requires the player to hit the green or blue spaces on a gauge with a constantly spinning needle. If he doesn’t hit the right field, he either gets a electro-shock or will sound the alarm. A successful hack on the other will lower the prices at vending machines or turn turrets over to the player’s side. The new mini-game also allows the player to fight and walk around while hacking as well as hacking from a distance thanks to the arrows shot by the hacking-tool.BioShock 2 features multiplayer for up to 10 players which was developed independently from the single player by a different developer and tells the story before the first game. By gaining ranks for kills and winning matches, the player unlocks access to additional radio messages advancing the story behind the civil war that raged in the city between the Splicers and Andrew Ryan’s security force. The available multiplayer-mode include Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture and Hold, Capture the Sister and Adam Grab. The latter requires the players to collect and protect the sole Little Sister in the level in order to gain points. Capture the Sister on the other hand puts two teams against each other with one team trying to bring the Little Sister to a vent and the other trying to prevent that. Each mode also features the possibility of one player slipping into the role of a Big Daddy.",

A nuclear missile carrier is out of control on a one way-set path, and unless that path is cleared, it will explode as soon as it makes contact with anything, destroying the world. It is up to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier.Blast Corps is a mix of an action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each level the player is given a certain vehicle (ranging from robotic suits to trucks or bulldozers), and are told to clear the path for the Carrier. Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don't affect certain buildings, and sometimes it's not even a building that's in the way. The player must use the resources around them to clear the path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to move boxes out of the way. The Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one obstruction, they must get to the next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find six scientists scattered throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to leave Earth, and it's your job to ensure that it will!Blast Corps features secrets to find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go back to a level once it has been completed to take their time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must also find RDUs (Radiation Dispersal Units), which light up on the ground when the player is in close proximity to them, as well as destroy all of the buildings, rescue all of the homeless civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the player on every mission. There are also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating special satellite dishes hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a level they receive a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny message for them...",

Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.Body Harvest is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.Each vehicle has its own speed, armor, and fuel capacity attributes. Controllable vehicles range from armored cars and tanks to boats, helicopters, planes, and even a space ship during a few missions. Buildings scattered around levels may contain useful items, ammunition, and fuel. The player has to avoid killing innocent people; too many casualties result in a premature end of the game. Typically, the main goals in each area are to destroy the alien Shield Generator, defeat a boss enemy, and proceed to the next stage.",

Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the \"power ball\" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the \"E\" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.",

Their goal: the legendary vault which is said to be filled with treasures beyond imagination hidden on the planet by an ancient highly advanced alien race. One of those fortune-seekers is the protagonist, who has one advantage: the guidance of the Guardian of the vault.Borderlands is a mixture of a first-person shooter and a role-playing game, somewhat similar in concept to Hellgate: London. At the beginning of the game the player chooses between one of four characters:\nRoland: A former soldier. He likes to play with rifles and shotguns and has a Scorpio-Turret at his disposal to keep his back clear.\nLilith: A Siren and Phasewalker. She can turn invisible and fights with extreme speed.\nMordecai: A hunter. He prefers to snipe enemies from a distance and has access to a bird of prey called Bloodwing.\nBrick: A Berserker. He doesn't care much for guns and instead uses his fists to win all arguments.\nEach of the four characters has three different skill trees available, filled with talents that e.g. increase bullet damage or allow the player to resurrect a friend in cooperative game. The player gets one skill point to spend at each level up, which is earned through gaining enough experience points by killing enemies and fulfilling quests for the various NPCs inhabiting the planet Pandora. To kill all those enemies and survive the journey, the protagonist will find weapons, ammunition, useful items like shields or medipacks, upgrades and money on the enemies he or she kills, in chests scattered around the landscape, or purchased at vending machines. Weapons and shields come in different types of quality, can have several different types of attributes and mostly come with a level requirement. The maximum level a character can reach is 50.Since the protagonist has to travel around much, he or she has a buggy available armed with a machine gun and a rocket launcher or heavy machine gun at later levels. Since the game also features a drop in/drop out-coop-mode for up to four players, the buggies have enough room for two players with one using the mounted turret and the other driving around the vehicle.",

If you come in contact with one of these, you will lose a life.

Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms.

            "Description": "Bully is a story of one Jimmy Hopkins, whose academic success hasn't been anything spectacular as he's been expelled from various schools. His parents have a grand idea of sending him to Bullworth Academy which -- despite its grand name -- houses lots of other kids like Jimmy. This is the place where future dictators, murderers, and mad scientists reside. With a help of a few friends, some wits and hard-as-a-rock fists, Jimmy has to survive through one year in Bullworth Academy.Often described as \"GTA in high school\", the game indeed has many similarities with the famous car-hijacking series. It features a \"sandbox\" environment, which encompasses not only the vast high school grounds, but also the nearby town of Bullworth. As in GTA games, the player can choose to complete missions in different order, or simply roam the game world, interacting with the environment and the characters. Naturally, much of the typical GTA-like content has been changed to fit the high school setting. The violence is still present: Jimmy can punch and kick anyone he encounters, as well as use a variety of (non-lethal) weapons such as slingshots, fire crackers, and even self-made guns. It is not possible to hijack cars, but Jimmy is able to steal and ride bicycles. The missions include a variety of gameplay styles: chases, races, shooter-like sequences, escort missions, spying, random acts of vandalism, and many more.Bully features a plethora of activities and mini-games that can be accessed outside of the missions. Jimmy can simply attend classes and study. Each class is built like a mini-game: for example, language lesson involves composing as many words as possible out of a few given letters within a time limit. It is possible to find, buy, and wear different outfits, get jobs and earn money, and even date schoolmates and buy presents for them.",

            "Description": "Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while avoiding collisions. Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.  Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure.  Designers have built city districts and surrounding areas, and implemented the race courses throughout the streets.  As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races.  As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving.  Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost \"burnout\" meter.  Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to drive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way.  The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!Burnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign.  While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints.  You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.  Along with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact includes new modes of play.  Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race.  Or you can reverse that with a friend.  You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you.  Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible.  The bigger the crash, the better.  Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.Training and 2 player racing modes are also included.",

Rather than dividing races into different sections, the player can fully explore Paradise City as an open world, where every junction is an opportunity to start an event. Just pull up at the traffic lights and rev the engine to start an event. The same applies to the Showtime mode (formerly Crash mode). The preset junctions and traffic are no longer present and the player can now crash at any location in the world, by activating the Showtime mode. It can also be used in regular modes, as well as online games. The main game mode has the player earn credit to unlock new licenses and cars. The five main event types are:\nRace: the first one to reach the finish wins.\nRoad Rage: perform a number of takedowns before time runs out.\nMarked Man: race for a location and survive the attacks from another car that tries to take you down.\nStunt Run: use stunt moves to reach a target score.\nBurning Route: a unique route for each car in the game.There are more than 80 cars present and there is a reworked damage system. More parts can be torn off and the state of the car determines if the player can keep driving or has to wait for a reset. Objects in the environment can now also be deformed.The game supports mugshots with support for a camera. When a player is taken down, both players have their photo taken, exchanged and saved on the hard drive. There are also camera-less persons or an avatar can be used.",

Sometime in the 20th century, a group of Narukagami ninja, each proficient in a different style, find themselves in a battle to regain their honor in the fighting ring.Bushido Blade is a versus fighting game with several unique features. It does away with health bars, special meters, and other traditional gimmicks and allows for battles to be won with a single hit. Players select from among six ninja, each of a different fighting style and attributes. Players also choose equipment from among eight weapons, including Japanese swords, European blades, naginata and a sledgehammer. Battles take place in wide open areas in which combatants can run around as well as climb up and down. Some structures, like bamboo trees, can even be cut down. In the single player game, players can even run through the entire castle, picking a preferred fighting ground location. In addition to the single player story mode, there's a versus mode, a slash mode where you will be attacked by 100 generic ninja in one long corridor, a training, and a 'POV' mode, which allows players to play from first person, heightening the realism. The game's versus mode can also be played using two Playstations linked up.Gameplay involves picking one of three stances, then attacking high, middle, or low. Directions while attacking change attacks, and attacks can be combo'd. Player damage is location based, with hits to arms often making them useless, hits to legs crippling, and hits to heads and clean across the torso being mortal. The use of stances and the easily achieved one hit kills make Bushido Blade one of the most deadly, and therefore realistic, weapon fighters around. ",

With a group of allied soldiers, you have to take on the Nazi Wehrmacht in missions all over Europe, from D-Day to a tank factory, the Pegasus bridge, crossing the Volga river and infiltration missions in a P.O.W. camp and a dam. Before each assignment, you are given a short introduction of the environment and a team selection is suggested based on their abilities. You can only select three team members per mission.The objective is always to reach a spot marked by a red flag with as many team members alive as possible. The different classes include infantry, a sniper, an engineer, a medic and a commando. You control only one unit at a time, but you can order the other ones to follow you or to take cover. The other members are controlled by the computer's AI and will engage enemy soldiers on sight if you order them to follow you. You can switch between team members to move them around or to use their special abilities. All members can fire regular bullets, in four directions, but a medic can heal your soldiers, the sniper can shoot the entire screen when there is a clean line of fire, the infantry has grenades to blow up objects or doors and the engineer carries heavy explosives. The final unit, the commando, can pass through locked doors and stays undetected for ten seconds in a new room. This time frame can be used to sneak up on enemies and take them out with your knife.Each unit has an armour class and you can pick up items on the battlefield: a medi-pack to restore health, a crate to restock your secondary weapon and a flak jacket granting invincibility for ten seconds. Although it is sometimes possible to finish missions with a single unit, you will often need the different classes to get past obstacles. There is only one type of enemy soldier and they can shoot in eight directions. The fastest time per mission is stored as a challenge to beat.",

The upper screen is where the action occurs, while the lower one is used for the map and the interaction (like taking and changing weapons or using gun turrets). In addition, there are a couple of touchscreen minigames to deactivate bombs and hacking circuits.The multiplayer includes modes like deathmatch and capture the flag, with a variant of the last one called \"Iron Man\", where the flag carrier has to hold it as long as he/she can.

Each mission besides the aforementioned vehicle missions contains four intel items which can be collected.The game also features other modes such as Quick Play (replay any mission from the campaign), Challenge Mode (has specific goals for the player to do on a mission), Arcade Mode (lets the player play the main campaign missions but this time with a set number of lives and a time limit), Zombie mode.(has four maps), a Multiplayer mode (has twelve maps), and the Killhouse mode which lets the player race through a shooting range blasting targets.\n",

The world is once again at the brink of destruction. The Russians, originally defeated by the Americans, make Zhakaev a hero and threaten once again the peace on earth. Worse: they get help by a known terrorist who tries everything to let escalate the tension into a full-scale-war. In the middle: the player. During his missions he will slip into the shoes of PFC. Joseph Allen, Sgt. Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson who is a member of Task-Force 141 and the hero of the first game, Captain \"Soap\" McTavish – leader of said task-force.As it's predecessor, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person-shooter that provides a fairly linear but heavily scripted and action-oriented single-player-experience. The missions take the player all over the world shooting, sneaking and driving through enemy lines to fulfill his various objectives like blowing up a fueling station. To fight all those hordes of ever respawning enemies, he has access to a large collection of modern-world-weaponry but can only carry two weapons plus grenades at a time.This is also true for the multiplayer-mode of the game which again features an extensive ranking system with the players gaining experience points for killing enemies, winning a round or completing objectives. Once enough experience points have been collected, the player advances in rank and unlocks new game-modes (ranging from deathmatch to pure team-oriented modes), new dog-tags and new weapons and abilities with which he can create his own custom class besides the five standard classes available. Also available is a coop-game-mode for two players called \"Spec Ops\" featuring several missions going on besides the main campaign in three different difficulty-settings with several different objectives including getting from A to B in a certain amount of time. These missions can also be completed alone however. ",

            "Description": "Captain Forever is a space shoot-em-up set in the vector-based void of classic '80s arcade games in space settings.  The player pilots a small red command module, the Nemesis, and from this mobile base must construct a spaceship consisting of girders, boosters and lasers.  While some modules are provided at the start, rival vessels are the only source of further components.  These are destructible, and are only released intact upon destruction of a ship's attached command module.  Enemies begin at a low level, but increase in power as the player destroys higher level ships.  The objective is to reach the highest Law rating by destroying the most powerful enemies, but the game continues indefinitely until the player's command module is destroyed.Once the player (or a rival) destroys another vessel's command module, any surviving components are detached and float in empty space.  From there, they may be dragged with the mouse and orthogonally welded onto the player's ship.  Each component has a class, denoted by the old military alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.).  The higher the class, the greater the power, mass and hit points of the component.Movement is similar to Asteroids, and takes into account the inertia, mass distribution and thrust power of a ship's components, so asymmetric designs are unwieldy without careful planning, heavy designs without a sufficient number of boosters are very slow, etc.  Lasers fire either straight or in a prismatic V, and are the only way to destroy enemy command modules.  Lasers also will destroy other modules, whether they are attached to a ship or floating in space.  Any attached components that lose their connection to a ship's command module will also be destroyed.The player's ship design may at any time be exported and shared via hyperlink.  Anyone using the link will start with the exact vessel exported.  Creative design is encouraged due to the strategic problems posed by the mechanics: the player must learn to target enemy command modules without destroying their useful attached components.  Building takes place in real-time, right in the middle of the action.  Only when the Law level has been increased does the game provide the player a short breather from enemy harassment.",

Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.

            "Description": "Castle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat-em-up involving knights who need to retrieve a stolen gem and many princesses for their king. Using a hand-drawn style as seen in Alien Hominid, players can initially choose from four different knights with separate fighting styles, along with the alien from Alien Hominid. Other characters (20 in total) are later unlocked or discovered through the course of the game. Although the game can be played by a single player, up to four player can fight together on the same screen in the cooperative game modes, both offline and online. Some elements in the levels can only be activated or interacted with by specific characters.Starting with basic moves, defeating enemies fills up an experience meter (up to 99 levels) that provides skill points. These can be attributed to strength, magic, defence and agility and consequently unlock a large amount of new moves and combos. Basic movement includes jumping, a light and a strong attack, blocking and magic. While playing, there are 40 different weapons to collect (included ranged ones such as a bow), each with different attributes. Only one can be wielded at a time, but all discovered weapons are stored at a blacksmith. The different levels are shown on a map where the player can move around and revisit locations. Some are locked until the player is strong enough. There are also shopping areas where life potions can be stocked, along with new weapons. Characters can also move around on mounts such as lizards, when they are captured.Another element is the animal orbs. They become available through the game and acts as companions that assist the player, through attacks, defence or special abilities such as digging up hidden items in the levels. As in all games by The Behemoth, there is a focus on wacky humour in the game design and animations. When playing together with other players, after defeating a boss the knights need to fight each other to win the princess' kiss.Next to the main game there are also arena fights against increasingly difficult waves of enemies and the All You Can Quaff mini-game where players button-mash to eat as quickly as possible. Through the different playing styles of the characters, there is plenty of replayability.",

While attempting to return to a normal life Soma is attacked by the leader of a cult with the intention of reviving Count Dracula. He, as well as friends from his last adventure, are drawn to the cult's headquarters to prevent another age of darkness.All the action takes place on the lower screen, while the top screen is used to see the map or your character's stats. Soma can still equip various kinds of weapons, armor, and monster souls, although the exact powers of the souls have changed slightly from the previous game. Instead of multiples of the same soul just taking up space they are now necessary, as many abilities will not reach their full power unless Soma possesses nine duplicates of the soul. Yoko Belnades has set up an enchanting store inside the castle, allowing Soma to merge souls with weapons in his possession to forge more powerful weapons. The game also takes advantage of the touch screen feature to let you draw magic runes to perform powerful moves to defeat evil monsters.For the first time in a Castlevania game simultaneous multiplayer modes are possible. Place monsters in a series of rooms and then blaze through it with a friend over wireless connection, either competitively or cooperatively. Trading extra souls between carts is also possible over wireless communication.The mobile version is a fairly genuine port of the original game with a few minor differences. It adds a new special rare item: the lost soul vial. This item can be used if Soma dies and resurrects him. There is also the bat altar which can be used when Soma owns the bat form ability. Soma walks on a bat altar with the bat ability and is teleported to the linked bat altar. The inventory is strictly limited to weapons, armors and magic spells. It is not possible to store food, life potions or other items.",

Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters into the castle to find some answers and confront his own father.Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Rondo of Blood. Unlike the previous installments of the series, the game is set in a castle which the player can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of \"special moves\" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.The Saturn release adds two new areas to the castle (the Underground Garden and the Haunted Path), a third playable character (Maria), and a few new remixed music tracks. However, it sacrifices a few of the graphical effects from the PlayStation version, particularly true transparencies. All other releases are based on the PlayStation version, and do not feature these changes.",

            "Description": "Serge is a young boy from a fishermen's village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence.Chrono Cross is a Japanese-style role-playing game, and a sequel to Chrono Trigger. The game's story is not directly connected to that of its predecessor, though there are sub-plots and characters that refer to it. Combat in the game is turn-based; like Chrono Trigger, the game has no random battles, and enemies are always visible on screen. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong, which tend to miss more frequently but inflict more damage. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. There are also no character levels in the game: instead, the characters get their parameters increased directly after each battle. All magic spells, character-specific tech attacks, and consumable items are grouped into six elements, which are divided into three pairs with opposing properties. Each player-controlled character and enemy has an innate element, which enhances the power of spells categorized under it when used by said character, but also weakens his or her resistance to the opposing element. Battle fields may also be marked by a particular element, granting bonuses to attacks based on it, and reducing the damage caused by the opposing one. Player-controlled characters have differently shaped grids which allow the player to allocate purchased or found elements there. When the character participates in a battle, the allocated elements act as equipped spells, and can be cast until their amount is depleted.Though most of the plot progression is linear, there are several sub-quests that are not required to complete in order to reach the game's ending. The game features many recruitable characters (up to 45, though not all of them can be recruited in one playthrough), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the statistics and items from the previous play.",

            "Description": "A young man named Crono is about to enjoy a carefree day: he plans to go to the Millennial Fair, where his friend Lucca intends to demonstrate her newest scientific invention: a teleporter. Upon his arrival Crono meets a young girl named Marle, who volunteers to be the first to test Lucca's new device. However, Marle's pendant affects the teleporter's mechanism in a mysterious way, and as a result she is teleported four hundred years into the past. Crono and Lucca quickly recreate the time portal and follow Marle. They find out that her unexpected appearance has created some confusion, and proceed to fix the error, which in turn leads to unforeseen consequences, eventually compelling the heroes to travel to different time periods and change the history of the world.Chrono Trigger is a Japanese-style role-playing game in which the player takes control of a party consisting of up to seven characters, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. There are no random encounters in the game: all the enemies are either visibly walking on the field maps and can be avoided by the player, or are waiting to ambush the party. No enemy encounters occur when the player navigates characters over the world map.The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games as one of the combat style selections offered to the player in the beginning. The other selectable battle mechanic pauses combat whenever the player accesses the menu, effectively removing the real-time element and rendering the battles fully turn-based.As the characters grow in power, their parameters increase, and they learn new \"techs\" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them magic points to use in battle. Techs may target a specific formation of enemies (e.g. a line) and can be used tactically depending on the enemies' positioning in combat. Characters may execute techs individually or perform double or triple techs, where each character contributes a tech which is combined with one or two others to unleash a powerful attack.Once player-controlled characters acquire the ability to travel freely between time periods, the game's plot develops in a non-linear fashion. From that point on the player may opt to face the game's final adversary in combat and complete the story, or perform other plot-related quests. Depending on the moment of the story when the player decides to proceed to the final battle, the game may be concluded with thirteen different endings. The New Game+ option allows the player to start the game anew after having previously completed it, carrying over levels, techs, and equipment of the characters. The PlayStation version features an anime-style introduction movie and cutscenes, a \"movie theater\" mode which allows the player to re-watch these movies and listen to the game's songs, as well as an unlockable bestiary, dungeon maps, and art gallery. The Nintendo DS version retains these changes and adds two new dungeons and a new possible ending that foreshadows the events of Chrono Cross.",

Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing.  The ducklings also eat the corn, however.There are only 8 distinct levels.  The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on.  However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders.

Again. The story is told in humorous cutscenes, but does play a negligible role. More important are the randomly generated levels which take the player's skill in previous levels and chosen difficulty level into account - in principle the campaign is designed to be always challenging.Gameplay itself is platforming standard: Bob walks and jumps from left to right while avoiding all kinds of obstacles. Some enemies can be destroyed by jumping on them and the level can be directly restarted after dying; there is no game over. In some levels there is auto-scrolling or Bob receives gimmick abilities like a jet-pack or he constantly grows and shrinks. Of course the levels are generated to account for the ability. The player always can activate a help option where an AI character shows how to beat the level - but it has to be bought with crystals which can be collected during the levels.Besides the campaign, players can also engage in free play (all parameters of level creation can be freely adjusted), Time Crisis (players are on a time limit which has to be expanded by collecting crystals), Hero Rush (randomly assigns gimmick abilities) and Hybrid Rush (like Hero Rush, just sometimes with multiple abilities at once). Each mode, including the campaign, can be also played in co-op. An even bigger challenge is the bungee mode in which players are connected with a bungee cord.",

All blocks are the same shape but the coloured squares they contain will vary. The player can position the blocks with the left/right keys, rotate the coloured squares within the block with the up key, and drop the block with the down key. The object is to align the colours so that three or more in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line are all of the same colour, when this happens they flash and disappear causing the squares above to drop down. The process repeats until either the player gets bored or the screen fills up.\n",

There is both a single player mode, in which the player must advance through 30 levels, and multi-player mode, which allows deathmatch style play.Just as in the Atari 2600 game, the tanks' turrets do not turn.  However, the tanks turn quicker and hover, rather than relying on treads.  This allows them to slide left and right, as well as forward and back.In single player mode, the player must find the exit in each level to advance.  The levels range from the simple \"shoot and destroy until the exit appears\" to the complicated \"journey back and forth destroying the enemies required to open gates.\"  There are also levels in which a \"boss\" must be defeated to advance.Multiplayer mode supports play over a LAN or the Internet.  The CD-ROM also includes the GameSpy Arcade software if you wish to use it for Internet play.The CD-ROM also includes a map editor, although it is officially unsupported.",

With Pacific City under the iron grip of three ruthless gangs: Los Muertos, the Volk, and the Shai-Gen Corporation; the last hope rests on The Agency, a highly skilled group of law enforcers.  But the situation is dire, and desperate times call for desperate measures.  Using technology from one of Shai-Gen's scientists, The Agency is creating superhuman Agents to combat the crime and take back the city.  With constantly evolving skills which increase as you use them, you've certainly got the upper hand... but these gangs won't give back Pacific City without a fight!Crackdown is an action game from the creator of Grand Theft Auto; and presents the player with the fully explorable world of Pacific City.  Your main goal is to defeat the gangs that have taken over various parts of the city.  You're quite welcome to tackle each gang's head honcho straight off; however, it's to your advantage to take down the lower rungs in the gang ladder before you head for the top.  Doing so will cripple various parts of the gang, such as vehicles, cash flow, and new recruits.Your Agent can upgrade particular types of skills: Agility - your running speed and jump height; Driving - your control of different types of vehicles; Explosives - your skill and damage radius of explosives; Strength - your physical strength, which allows you to punch, as well as lift and throw heavier objects; and Weapons - your skill and accuracy with assorted types of weaponry.  Each type of skill is increased by performing the associated action.  Drive around and your Driving skill will increase, punch people in the face or throw garbage skips at them to increase your strength, and keep up the shooting to improve your weapon skills.  Agility is measured differently - scattered throughout Pacific City are green Agility Orbs.  Nab these, and your Agility will increase.  The higher up the orb is, the more it's worth.  You can also increase your Driving and Agility skills even further via special races which can be found around the city.",

            "Description": "1927. When Inspector Raoul Dusentier is invited to a cruise upon a mighty sailing ship by the wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan, he looks forward to nothing but a relaxing week on the sea. Instead, his host manages to get himself killed on the second day. Murdered, to be exact. Too convenient that a policeman is aboard -- Dusentier sets out to search for suspects. He doesn't need to search long. Why is it that none of the family members seem awfully sad about the demise of the old man? Is the mysterious Father Fabiani really as pious as he says? In the tradition of Agatha Christie, each and every person on board has a motive for the murder.Cruise for a Corpse is a graphic adventure game with a point-and-click interface.You advance in the plot not so much by solving common object-based puzzles, but by talking to the right persons about the right subjects at the right time, thus collecting clues. You will also find pieces of evidence scattered throughout the ship. However, most items suddenly appear in cupboards and drawers that were previously empty. The clock advances in ten-minute-steps whenever you discover an interesting clue, which conveniently informs you of your progress. The protagonists move around the ship; so whenever time passes, different persons to talk to might appear at certain locations.With this game, Delphine Software's Cinematique interface reached \"Evolution 2\". Instead of containing a fixed number of verbs, the command menu is now context-sensitive. The mouse cursor will change its appearance when moved over an interesting object; a left-click brings up a set of appropriate verbs. For example, a cupboard may be opened and searched, whereas a key can be picked up and turned. A right-click accesses the inventory. The game features polygonal characters.",

Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of \"P\" power-ups left by defeated enemies. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen, but is constantly advancing towards new threats.The PlayStation 2 version is not a straight port or emulation of the original SNES game. It has altered visuals and balance tweaks, as well as a brief new stage at the beginning.",

Beginner Mode only requires you to press either the D-Pad or a button, and will play harder sections of songs for you by touching the touch screen when shown. As you progress through the Amateur and Pro modes, you'll be using all eight face buttons/directions to play an entire octave, and shoulder buttons to modify the note, making it a sharp or an octave higher.The top screen shows the next few bars of music, with the buttons you are required to press to play your instrument. A marker will move along each bar, showing the notes the player needs to play. Correctly playing the right notes at the right time will result in the song playing perfectly, while too many mistakes will create a mess of inaccurate sounds.In multiplayer mode, up to eight players on one cartridge each pick a different instrument and try and play a song together, with each player hearing everyone else's mistakes.A unlockable song editor allows you to create your own MIDI compositions, and then play these normally in the game. You can also create simple songs by humming or whistling into the microphone.",

On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the limited hardware of the Saturn and Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the arcade version.",

            "Description": "The fourth installment in the Dead or Alive series (excluding Beach Volleyball) continues in a similar vein of fighting game. Delivering another dose of combo heavy action set in a variety of highly interactive locations.With Helena assuming control over DOATEC an eclectic cast of fighters from all corners of the world all battle each other for some personal goal. Each character has vastly different, and often unusual, motives.In the main game's story mode each character fights through a series of encounters, often with a bizarre context eg. taking exception to cruelty to a T-Rex and a fight over a fresh lettuce are both examples of the rather odd but still hilarious Japanese humour.XBOX Live support allows players to watch fights while waiting for their turn in the arena. VOIP is also supported, as with many Live games.Featuring a graphical upgrade and an improved fighting system (tested by some top DOA players before release) Dead or Alive 4 is aimed not only at the older DOA players, but enticing new gamers due to the less intimidating control system, and giving slightly less advantage to the experienced.",

            "Description": "You play as Frank West, a freelance photo-journalist, and you're on a hunt for the scoop of a lifetime. Following a lead to the town of Willamette, he finds that the town has been practically taken over by zombies. Trying to get away, Frank makes his way to the Willamette shopping mall hoping he can find help there.Gameplay takes place in a set seventy-two-hour period where one hour of real time equals twelve hours in game. Frank can freely move about the entire mall, though some areas are not accessible in the beginning. Most of it is infested with zombies, but he has a safe base in a security room. Players can follow the main plot, where they must be in the right place at the right time and successfully complete missions in order to advance, or do side missions, wander around killing zombies and dressing up in clothes from the mall stores, or just stay on the roof and wait for the helicopter to come back to pick him up. The helicopter comes at the end of the three days and the game is over regardless of whether Frank is on the roof to get rescued.Frank gains experience by taking pictures, rescuing survivors and killing zombies. As he gains experience, he levels up, which gives him new moves, a larger inventory and more health.Pictures are scored based on the number of survivors or zombies, their proximity to the camera and on emotional content, like horror, humor or sexiness.Survivors are located throughout the mall and Frank must show up at the right time to rescue them. If you show up too early, they may not be at their location yet and if you show up too late, they will be dead. Frank can lead survivors back tot he safety of the security room so they can be rescued. To do this, he can equip them with weapons and order them to follow him or wait at a specific location.Rescuing survivors is complicated by the huge crowds of zombies roaming around the mall. There can be up to one thousand on screen at a time. Frank must avoid getting bitten and make sure the survivor continue to survive as he leads them. In addition to the zombies, Frank must face off against psychopaths, who are human who snapped when they saw the zombies and have become crazed killers.Almost anything in the mall can be picked up and used. Food items restore health. Also everything else can be used as a weapon. Obvious, it's far more effective to kill zombies with a sub-machine gun or a chainsaw than by throwing CDs at them or hitting them with a mannequin, but you do have options and you may have to resort to killing zombies with a bowling ball or with you bare hands because all weapons have limited ammunition or durability and will eventually run out. You can pick up books from bookstores. These give you bonuses, like increased durability for a class of weapons, while in your inventory. There are also several vehicles you can use.In keeping with the real-time theme, you are only allowed one save slot. Frank can save in bathrooms and in the security room, but this will overwrite and previous saves. If you make a mistake, you have to either restart the game, though you keep your current levels, or live with it and move on. This means your decisions do have consequences.Once you complete the main plotline, you go into overtime mode, where Frank, rather than getting on the helicopter, gets another twenty-four hours to resolve the plot. If you beat overtime mode, you get infinite mode, where the helicopter isn't coming back, Frank loses health over time and all the survivors are trying to kill him. The object here is to stay alive as long as possible.",

Two player co-op is also available.Gameplay is handled as an on-rails shooter. The player has no active control over their movement, and limited control over their view. In the Wii version, the Wiimote is used to handle weapons from the original game, with gestures like turning the remote sideways used to switch to a secondary fire mode, or holding the remote up to your ear to play discovered audio logs. The touted \"strategic dismemberment\" system from Dead Space also returns here, requiring careful aim against limbs to reliably take creatures down.",

            "Description": "Def Jam: Fight for NY is the sequel to the out-of-left-field Def Jam: Vendetta.The game opens with the person you beat in the previous game, D-Mobb, being arrested.  As the police are driving, an SUV comes out of nowhere and smashes into the car, setting D-Mobb free.  After a quick cutscene, it turns out the person who was driving the SUV was you, and you have now joined D-Mobb's crew.Fight for NY's story mode takes you through the ranks, and pits you against tougher and tougher fighters.  You start off in D-Mobb's crew as a nobody, and will have to work your way up, fighting off people from other crews, including D-Mobb's rival, Crow.  You'll take part mostly in one-on-one brawls, with the odd team match and free for all thrown in.To aid you in fighting, you can use the environment to hurt your enemy.  You can smash people into wooden/cement walls, fences, or just whack them off of a wooden pillar.  Speakers, soda machines, garbage cans... All there to harm your enemy (or you).  Some objects are interactive, such as flood lights, which will change the lighting of the ring once someone's been thrown into them.  You have weapons at your disposal, usually a metal pipe, pool cue and broken bottle.The crowd also gets into the action, which can be good or bad for you.  You can throw an enemy into a crowd and have them push him towards you; you can knock a stunned enemy into the crowd, and they will hold him down, giving you free shots; or you can throw an opponent into a part of the crowd holding a weapon, and they'll use the weapon against him.There are five fighting styles available to you.  There is Street Fighting, which focuses on punches; Kickboxing, which focuses on kick attacks; Martial Arts, which focuses on speed, running, and acrobatic attacks; Wrestling, which focuses on standard wrestling moves, like bodyslams; and Submissions, which focus on wearing down a specific part of the enemy until that limb is damaged enough to earn a submission.In addition to Story mode, you have Battle mode, which allows you to play with up to four players in different types of matches.Fight for NY has lots of unlockables.  Earning reward points from Battle matches, you can purchase new fighters or venues to fight in.",

The whole world holds its breath as the President has chosen you to destroy Kilbaba and his terrorist army before he launches a nuclear attack on the world!You must fly a specially designed AH-64A Apache on a series of missions to rescue missing-in-action characters, destroy power plants, blow apart SCUD missiles, etc. to take out the enemy defense while trying to find out Kilbaba's plans.The player controls the helicopter from an overhead, isometric perspective. The Apache is equipped with three weapon types: a machine gun and two types of missiles of different strength. During the missions, the player must beware anti-aircraft guns, missile launchers and tanks, outmaneuvering enemy fire or destroying the enemy weaponry. The Apache is destroyed if its fuel runs out, or if the armor (functioning as health) is completely depleted. However, armor can be replenished by bringing back MIA soldiers and prisoners of war back to the landing zone. There are also fuel, ammo and armor pickups available on the field. ",

During each round the player is presented with a blank field that they must populate with a variety of towers, all having unique weapon capabilities.Some of the weapons include Pellet Towers, which simply fire  small pellets; Dart Towers, which of course fire darts; Frost Towers, which can freeze the enemy; and Ink Towers, which fire ink that traps the enemies in place. The enemies in this game are known as creeps, and there are multiple varieties which resemble various microorganisms. All have different abilities—some are more resistant to damage, others move faster, while some can even fly (necessitating the use of \"anti-aircraft\" towers). The player's score is calculated based on how many creeps escape to the exit, and how much time is left on the clock when they proceed to the next level (once all creeps are destroyed, the player can either wait out the clock, or click on a button to immediately go to the next level). Destroying creeps earns gold that can be used to buy or upgrade towers.  Upgrading towers makes them more powerful, and is necessary to defeat some of the more advanced creeps.",

            "Description": "Some time during the 2050's, the world is a dangerous place as terrorists, drug czars, and outlaw states rule, using violence and subterfuge as tools in their push for global conquest. A deadly virus dubbed \"gray death\" is running rampant throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as \"Ambrosia\" manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French terrorist organization \"Silhouette\" bombs the historic symbol of friendship between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, its mission is to attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service. While JC's brother Paul is already an active agent, JC is beginning his first day of service when the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) suddenly raid a supply of Ambrosia at UNATCO headquarters.Deus Ex is a dark cyberpunk game that combines gameplay styles of first-person shooter and RPG, with elements of stealth and puzzle-solving. The player assumes the role of JC Denton, UNATCO anti-terrorist agent. Pitted against an elaborate global conspiracy, he must interact with characters, pick up weapons and complete objectives. While JC is essentially fixed within the mission-framework of the game, he can be customized in areas such as weapons, technical skills and physical prowess. Completing objectives rewards the player with skill points, which may be distributed to increase JC's proficiencies in eleven different disciplines. The player can choose to increase the damage JC inflicts with various types of weapons, improve his lock-picking or computer hacking abilities, etc. Each such discipline has four levels of proficiency.Another way of customizing JC is applying nano-augmentations to his body. These cybernetic implants bestow the hero with super-human abilities, and can be installed on different body parts, up to nine at the same time. Along with combat-related benefits, nano-augmentations also grant DC abilities that can be used to overcome certain obstacles within the game world. Examples of those are jumping to extreme heights, swimming, lifting heavy objects, etc. Weapons can be customized as well: their range, accuracy, and magazine sizes can be increased, and they can be enhanced by attaching scopes, silencers, or laser sights to them.The game leads JC to various places all around the globe. The cities he visits, as well as most mission areas, are expansive and fairly open to accommodate different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on the player's preferred style of play. Most of the missions can be tackled in various ways, e.g. with brute force, stealth, or extensive usage of lock-picking and computer hacking abilities. At certain points, the course of the storyline can also be influenced by the decisions made by the player. Similarly to System Shock games, the environment is largely interactive, the player being able to pick up, use, and discard various types of objects.",

            "Description": "In a near future dominated by chaos, conspiracies and biomechanical augmentations, society is divided by various organizations fighting for supremacy, and large corporations extending their power beyond those of governments. An ideological war is growing between people who accept the biotechnological progress and people who fight it. A human revolution is coming.Adam Jensen is a thirty-four-year-old ex-SWAT member from Detroit, enrolled by a powerful biotechnology company named Sarif Industries. His job is to ensure the scientists' private security and safeguard the secrets of the company's projects. The first day after his hiring, Adam Jensen is about to attend a meeting with David Sarif, the founder and CEO of Sarif Industries, when suddenly a red alert is issued in the company laboratories.  A troop of mercenaries, apparently working for Belltower Associates, breaks in and kills several scientists. After having neutralized some of the mercenaries, Adam is severely injured by one of them. He has no choice but to be enhanced with biomechanical augmentations to save his life. His goal is now to discover what were the motivations of the attackers, and unravel a greater conspiracy behind their actions.Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the third game in the Deus Ex series. The events of the game take place in the year 2027, twenty-five years before those described in the first game. Like the first installment, the game is a hybrid of 3D shooter with a stealth angle and role-playing. All styles of play can be adopted to succeed in the missions, from a totally furtive mode (some bonuses are granted in case the player character hasn't been detected during the whole mission), to the most brutal one. The player's decisions may have an impact on the storyline. The game offers a vast array of weapons and biomechanical augmentations (hacking, social, stealth, sight, armor or combat skill enhancements, etc.). Various amounts of experience points are awarded for completing main or secondary quests, avoiding or eliminating enemies, hacking, reading electronic books and discovering secret passages. After having accumulated a certain quantity of experience points, the player is awarded a \"praxis kit\", which can be manually used to learn or improve an augmentation. These kits can also be found during exploration or purchased in clinics. Role-playing elements include, besides augmentations and general character-building, exploration of non-hostile areas and dialogue with non-playable characters. During certain crucial moments the player will have to participate in a \"conversation battle\" with a key character, selecting the correct psychological approach and influencing subsequent plot events. A few modifications have been made to the shooting gameplay, emphasizing its tactical aspect. Third-person cover system is integrated into otherwise fully first-person gameplay. Enemies often appear in groups led by a commander; taking out the latter may demoralize enemies, making them easier targets. Though the game still contains health-restoring items, the protagonist's health regenerates itself over time.",

In 1987 all UK records of the Department of Health and Social Security, Police and State Security are then coordinated in a central data bank. The year after, passport, censorship operations and communications were integrated. By 1994, the computer controlled all defense and internal security. Tuesday evening, the machine rebelled ...Players take control and follow the life of a \"defect\", in the shape of a human body, that has formed inside the machine. It is taken through all stages of life, from cells to senility, with many quotes from and references to William Shakespeare's The Seven Ages of Man from the play As You Like It (\"All the Screen's stage and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, and one person in their time plays many parts, their Acts being Seven Ages\"). The game is advertised as audio-visual entertainment. It contains no sound, but there is a cassette tape that needs to be played along with the game. Both sides contain 23 minutes of sound, forming 46 minutes which is also the length of the game as it is meant to be played in a single sitting. The tape's soundtrack contains singing, musical compositions, and speeches by a number of famous voice actors. They vaguely clarify the different stages of the game and often tease the player based on what is happening. The full transcript of the speech is also included in the manual.The player has to guide the defect through the different stages of life, constantly followed by the defect police. The game cannot be lost, but based on a number of actions a percentage shown all the time will vary. The player's controls consists of four directions, and the combination can form diagonal movement. The effect of the controls is different for every screen. Deus Ex Machina is based on a number of vignettes with limited gameplay. There are no win conditions for any part and controls do not appear to affect the game's progress. Screens have the player move a green dot between strings of DNA, ward off the defect police examining the body, jump over words such as \"LIES\" or \"WAR\" - where the relevance and atmosphere is generally provided through the background soundtrack. The game can be played without sound, but it does not make any sense that way. There are in-game instructions to synchronize and turn the tape.",

Each level is composed of a number of tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black hole. In one tile a red ball starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank. The goal of each level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without meeting the hole or a blank tile. \nTo ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.",

            "Description": "Knowing well that Diablo's spirit could never be truly destroyed, the hero of Tristram made the noblest sacrifice of all: he took the spirit of the Lord of Terror into himself, hoping that his strength of will could contain the demon within. He was wrong. Diablo's essence corrupted him, gradually taking over his human nature. He has turned into the Dark Wanderer, a mysterious being whose every step causes destruction and death. A nameless adventurer visits the Rogue Encampment and decides to help its inhabitants by slaying monsters surrounding the area, and eventually pursuing the Dark Wanderer himself.Like its predecessor, Diablo II is an action role-playing game. The player may choose between five available characters classes: Amazon (a rogue-like class with ranged attacks), Necromancer (can summon undead and inflict status ailments), Barbarian (a powerful melee fighter who can dual-wield weapons), Sorceress (offensive spellcaster), and Paladin (fights with shields and can cast support spells). Much of the game takes place in randomized dungeon-like areas heavily populated by enemies. Unlike the previous game, the environments are not restricted to a single dungeon and include variously themed locations, each with its own town and quests. The player character gains experience points from slaying monsters, and can be leveled up manually, increasing his or her primary attributes and acquiring abilities. Much of the customization relies on equipment and item combinations. Diablo's magic has been replaced with skills: class specific abilities that can be purchased with skill points as characters level up. For example, a Paladin's skills allow him to cover allies with a protective aura, while a Sorceress can learn to fire lightning bolts and frozen blasts from her hands. Skills can be purchased several times to level them up, and some skills, when purchased, will increase the effectiveness of other skills. A new item type, socketed, has been added as well. Socketed items can be modified permanently by adding magic gems to them, increasing their statistics or adding elemental properties.",

However, on his way from the airport to the city, a terrible earthquake occurs. The train collapses and Keith finds himself abandoned by the rescue team. Now he has to escape the island, try to save the people stranded on it, and discover the true reasons behind the chaos in the city. But that will be anything but easy. The earthquake continues, and any time Keith steps on a half-collapsed bridge, crawls over a pile of rumble, or climbs a narrow path between ruined houses, the Earth can start trembling...Disaster Report is a combination of pure adventure and survival horror genres. Controls, inventory management, fixed camera angles and relative vulnerability of the protagonist are reminiscent of Alone in the Dark and similar games, while the complete lack of enemies to fight reminds of a classic adventure. There are many ways to preserve Keith from constant dying. You can find items and combine them into new ones (for example, finding a helmet and a lamp will allow you to build a helmet with a flashlight attached to it). Keith will also need to quench his thirst, so you'll have to find water for him. The water taps found in the game also serve as save points.",

Instead his daughter, Rozalin is summoned, and Adell commits to returning her home to her father, as well as to defeating her father when they find him. The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also \"gang up\" on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking character. This action only uses the attacking character's turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with special items) the Dark Assembly with \"Mana\" you earn by defeating enemies.

            "Description": "After a two-year sleep, Prince Laharl awakens to find his father, King Krichevskoy, dead and the Netherworld in the middle of a civil war over who takes the throne. Not willing to give up his rightful place as the next king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back.The Overlord's castle acts as a hub to manage the party. It has shops to get new equipment, a gate to the different battles, a NPC to travel to the Item World, which is used to boost items, and the Dark Assembly, where the player can create new units, and have the assembly vote to pass (or not) special laws that will affect the game. To unlock some characters, a special chapter must first be unlocked by the Assembly.The story progresses in the form of chapters. In each chapter, new battles become one after another, with dialogues at the beginning and end of those battles. Any completed battle becomes available to play again, sometimes with minor changes. At the end of every chapter, a parody cut-scene announcing the next chapter,(most often, it is Etna who tells the story as if she were the protagonist) is shown.Battle\nIn a similar style to Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle, Disgaea is a turn-based strategy RPG on an isometric grid. Characters are dispatch in battle one after another, and each have a move action and an battle action. Each class has its own set of abilities, ranging from simple attacks and area attacks to magics that can affect all the battlefield. In each battle, up to ten bonuses can be obtained by clearing the Geo Panels and defeating enemies to fill the Bonus Gauge. The battle is won when all enemies are defeated, or, in the Item World, by accessing a gate to move to the next floor.\nThe Item World\nThe Item World is a world divided in floors, inside any of the player's item. The goal of the Item World is to progress through the floors, which raises the item's level. The more enemies are defeated before moving to the next floor, the more the item will improve. A special king of enemies, Residents, can be found in the Item World. These have their own level, and add a bonus to the item in which they reside. Once a Resident is defeated, it is \"subdued\", its level doubles and it can be moved between items. Residents can be fused together to get better bonuses. This is necessary because each item has a maximum number of Residents it can contain, determined by the item's rarity (common, rare or legendary) .",

The protagonists will form teams in order to fight through Chaos' armies and find their crystals which will later be used to destroy Chaos. Each character has his own campaign to go through at the end of which a crystal will be collected.The game also features a single fight and an arcade mode where the player will be able to choose his fighter and the opponent (opponents are automatically chosen by the game if playing in arcade mode though). \nAll of the character's experience and skills received through the campaign are saved for the other game modes (and vice-versa, for example: if Cloud had a level equal to 12 when completing the campaign, he will also appear to have the same level when viewing him in the character roster in Arcade or Quick Battle mode).Another feature is that the items you find during the campaign belong to you, the player. That means you can move items from a character to another.\nThe game also features extra content such as villains, costumes etc. which can be unlocked by using PP. You get such points from each fight and completed campaign.",

Set in the Rivellon world, Original Sin takes place 12 centuries before Divine Divinity, the first game in the saga, and thousands years after Divinity: Dragon Commander.Many centuries ago, a powerful magic called The Source was used to heal people and make good, but it happened that The Source became tainted, and the Sourcerers started to use The Source to hurt and destroy. The Council of Seven, the rulers of Rivellon, outlawed usage of The Source and send Source Hunters to investigate each time Source usage is suspected, and to eliminate the menace. You play two Source-Hunters sent by the Council to the city of Cyseal, where Councillor Jake was murdered.While you can play alone and control the two characters and their companions, the game is made with cooperative gaming for two players in mind. The dialog options you choose, and the actions you make modify your reputation, and therefore, affects how people will react. Combat in the game is turn-based, with action points, spells combos, and friendly fire.",

You control Donkey Kong by hitting the left or right bongos, while tapping both drums together or clapping allows for jumps, vine-swinging, wall-kicks, ground pounding and other moves.You have to cross 40 areas to rid the island of evil kongs. During your journey, you can travel using a variety of animals, and they each need a certain rhythm to control. Aside from the input device, it is a regular platformer with power-ups, bananas to collect, many enemies and end bosses.There are two versions of the game - one with the DK Bongos included and a lower-priced version without the device.",

Using the power of the scepter, Dhoulmagus destroyed the castle, placed a curse upon the kingdom and its people, and turned King Trode into a troll and the princess into a horse. A sole surviving castle guard journeys with the king, the princess, a reformed bandit named Yangus and a few other companions in search of the evil jester and a way to break the curse. Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game with random enemy encounters, simple turn-based combat mechanics, and management of a party consisting of four characters, each belonging to a clearly defined class. Unlike its predecessors in the series and most Japanese RPGs in general, the game features a continuous world with fairly vast landscapes and integrated towns and dungeons, as opposed to world map traveling and locations represented by icons. The game features full camera rotation and optional first-person view. Like in the previous Dragon Quest games, many objects can be interacted with; for example, barrels can be physically lifted, carried, and broken, to reveal items hidden within.In addition to experience points, the player receives skill points from battles, which can be manually allocated into a skill category of the player's choice. These categories include three different kinds of weapons, fisticuffs, and a discipline unique to each character. After a required amount of skill points has been invested into a particular category, the correspondent character learns a new ability or becomes more proficient with the chosen weapon. The Alchemy Pot system allows players to gather recipes and mix items to create new ones.The international version of the game features several updates to the original Japanese version, including voice acting, graphic menu, symphonic soundtracks, and flashier effects.",

            "Description": "Drop7 is a numbers-based puzzle game where the player drops colored balls, some containing numbers, onto a 7x7 grid. If a ball's number matches the amount of balls in its respective row or column, the ball disappears. The goal is to keep the board from overflowing at the top; after each round additional rows of random balls are dropped onto the grid. The player ideally would set up the balls such that one ball disappearing would place other balls into position to disappear as well, creating a chain reaction.The game has three modes: Normal, Hardcore, or Sequence. In the Sequence Mode, all players are given the same exact order of numbers each time, with the intent of developing a strategy.Drop7 started out life as a Flash game called Chain Factor, released as part of an ARG (alternate reality game) for the CBS television program Numb3rs. An episode called \"Primacy\" (episode 407) revolved around the characters investigating the death of someone involved in an ARG. The episode featured clues that led viewers to the Chain Factor website, which features \"error messages\" and other such ephemera that unveil the story of a megalomaniacal game developer. The campaign was considered successful, with the game receiving attention on a number of gaming sites. The game eventually received a face lift and name change, first appearing as a stealth release in the iPhone App store as snap7, then later making an official debut under its current name.",

In game modes A and B, players view a swampland from a first-person perspective. The dog scares the ducks out of the swamp, one at a time in mode A or two at a time in mode B. The ducks go flying around in the air and the player has three shots and a limited amount of time to shoot the ducks before they fly away. Each round only allows a limited number of misses in order to move on successfully. As the rounds progress, the ducks begin flying faster and faster, and fewer misses are allowed. In game mode A, a second player can control the movement of the duck using a controller plugged into port 2.Mode C features target practice on clay pigeons rather than ducks. The perspective and rules here are the same, with only three shots to destroy two clay pigeons before they disappear off the horizon. Destroy enough clay pigeons to move on to the next, tougher round.",

            "Description": "Dungeon Keeper is an adaptation of the 90s series of real-time strategy games, for mobile devices. The basic concept of the game is identical. The player has to build and design a dungeon to attract and train minions. These are used to defend the dungeon against minions and players that attempt to invade the dungeon and kill all evil minions. The controls are tailored for mobile devices with pinching for zooming, swiping for moving around, and touch and hold to select and move items or structures.The game is free-to-play and relies heavily on micro-transactions. To design a dungeon the player first has to dig out parts of the game world with imps, manage resource generation, build structures that produce units and construct defenses. The most important room in the game is the dungeon heart that needs to be protected at all costs. The player can determine the dungeon's entrances and then place traps such as retractable spikes, cannons, walls with razor blades to kill the invaders, and spells with bombs and flames. It is possible to turn opponents into chickens and squish them or summon a dragon that breathes fire all over the screen. Spells have a mana cost and a limited duration. Just like in the original game it is possible to build doors to just hold enemies back for a while. Different types of rooms can be constructed and these are needed to attract specific types of dungeons. Once set up, a room like the library offers to research further novelties to expand the dungeon while a hatchery provides food for the minions to raise the unit cap. Once a room has been set up it can still be moved around to another location if there is space available. The same process is used for managing traps. Next to imps familiar minions are skeletons, trolls, bile demons, mistresses and warlocks. Unlike the original game it is not possible to possess a body and watch through the eyes of one of the minions.Just like in the original game units can be slapped with the hand of evil to motivate them and boost efficiency, but now the player's actual hand is used through swipes. Once a proper dungeon has been set up it can be tested in practice matches or in multiplayer against another human player for a certain amount of gold, similar to Clash of Clans. Players are matched against other keepers with a similar strength. You do not need to be online to defend a dungeon, that is done automatically, but through a push notification you can watch the attack and intervene, or retaliate afterwards when not online. While actively playing a persistent internet connection is required however. There is a single-player campaign where both offensive and defensive scenarios are offered with increasing difficulty. When attacking with just the minions spells tied to characters can still be used and the player can decide which minions to deploy as well as when and where. Once a room has been claimed with a flag it can be used as a new entry point. Raids have a short time limit so players are encouraged to loot and attack aggressively.Gold, the basic currency, is also gathered through victories of over other players and is also spent on structures and upgrades. It is stored in treasuries that are vulnerable to invaders to steal. The other two in-game currencies are rock and mana, and the three of them are needed for most basic actions. Gems are the premium currency in the game. They are especially used to rush time to speed up the digging, build structures and upgrades and can be bought in large packs. Contrary to the original games the dungeon is meant to be kept over time and not started over with every session. That also implies that a match or a dungeon cannot be lost. When a dungeon is invaded, damaged and looted by another players, the only consequence is a small loss of resources as all other damage is repaired automatically. Players can work together and organize themselves in guilds to share resources and minions.",

However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.",

The game was public domain, so it was mainly distributed in Apple user groups and by trading with friends. The main game consists of the Eamon Master disk, which has the Main Hall and a short adventure called the Beginner's Cave. You start the game in the Main Hall, where you create a new character or select an old character. You are able to buy weapons, spells, and armor and go on your adventure.  Weapons come in five different types: Axe, Bow, Mace, Spear, and Sword.  There are three types of armor: Leather, Chain, and Plate. There are also several spells: Blast, a damage spell; Power, which has random effects, Heal, which cures you; and Speed, which increases your chance to hit.Character development is fairly simple.  Your character starts with random stats in three categories: Hardiness (how much you can carry and the amount of damage you can take), Agility (How good you are in combat) and Charisma (Affects the costs of items in the store and the friendliness of monsters).  You also has percentage ratings for each of the weapon types that determine, along with the armor penalty, whether you can hit or not.  These percentage ratings have a chance of going up every time you hit a monster with that type of weapon.The game is entirely text-based, though the construction set allows the addition of graphics. You interact with the environment typing simple one or two-word game commands such as ATTACK RAT, INVENTORY,  or NORTH.  There is no option to save your game, so death is often quick, sudden, and final.  ",

Together, these four friends have the power to defeat Giygas and save the world from his chaotic reign!EarthBound is a sequel to Mother. It is a top-down role-playing game in which the heroes travel around Eagleland and various other, exotic countries, trying to end Giygas' evil influence. On the way, Ness and his friends will encounter a lot of enemies and battle them in turn-based combat. Unlike in the previous game, enemies are visibly walking on the screen. Each turn, each of the characters in the party can attack with their weapons, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic powers that can hurt enemies, heal comrades and more; some also have some other, unique special powers), use an item or try and escape. The game features \"rolling HP meters\" - when a character is dealt damage, it's not all taken away from his HP right away, but instead his HP decreases slowly; if the combat is ended quickly, even a massively damaging attack can leave a character with only minor injuries. By winning battles, characters receive experience and thus become stronger. If the player-controlled characters are strong enough, weak enemies will escape from them instead of trying to attack; when chased down, they will be defeated instantly.Saving the game is done by finding a telephone and calling Ness' father. When the heroes defeat enemies, Ness' bank account receives money, which can be then retrieved from ATM machines throughout the game and spent in shops to buy better equipment or useful items. ",

Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.The main part of the gameplay in Ecco the Dolphin relies on exploring various aquatic levels. They are usually nonlinear, with submerged caverns and tunnels branching out from the main bodies of water. The navigation is impeded by islands that must be hopped over, volcanoes that spit hot lava, powerful currents, deadly spikes, and dangerous predators such as octopi and giant eels. The sonar ability has multiple functions: you can communicate with friendly animals, map out the nearby area (echolocation), activate glyphs, and eventually defeat enemies. Activating glyphs is necessary because they can unlock unexplored parts of the current level, including the exit that leads to the next area; some of them can even bestow the gift of invincibility on Ecco for a limited time.You must keep an eye on the life and breath meters. Dolphins can't stay underwater for a long period of time and must return to the surface for air. However, the cavern systems may hide the occasional pocket of air as well. Every time you are hit by spikes, lava, or an enemy, Ecco loses health, and once it reaches zero you will have to replay the level from the beginning. The life meter can be replenished by eating fish or by finding healing clams, called the Shelled Ones, and communicating with them. It's possible to avoid most enemies, but Ecco can kill troublesome creatures using the death sonar or by charging them head-on.",

This implies that different actions are possible based on the camera perspective, which is changed when the player rotates the camera.For the PSP there are two different versions. The UMD game offers 105 levels with three game modes for each: Solo mode (walk alone), Pair mode (control a white and black mannequin - when they meet each other they merge into a grey one and the puzzle is solved) and Others (solo mode with the additional of black enemies). The PlayStation store version is called echochrome Micro and only offers 56 levels with the three game modes.All versions have a built-in editor. On the PS3 levels can be easily exchanged through the PlayStation Network. The system will also automatically download ten custom puzzles, rated highly by other users, to a maximum of 300. When the maximum amount has been reached, older ones are replaced.",

While the former requires the player to manage his vast empire by moving troops around and upgrading his cities. But as opposed to its predecessor Rome: Total War, now only have space for up to six buildings like barracks. Everything else has to be build at specific places in the cities surroundings including coal mines, farms and such. This in return increases the wealth of a region and over time small villages scattered inside the province will advance to cities and once again provide the player with up to six buildings slots. Another addition are the three technology trees, allowing the player to research in the fields of military, economic or social and giving him access to new types of units, buildings or additional upgrades.Once a unit, representing an army on the map, comes in contact with an enemy unit or settlement, the player can choose to either let the CPU decide the battle or go in himself on the 3D-terrain and order his troops around.Besides normal land and siege battles, already present in the previous iterations of the series, Empire: Total War now also features sea battles. In these long and challenging battles, the player has the ability to control everything from manually firing the cannons of a ship to the striking or hoisting of the sails of a ship as well as choosing to board an enemy ship instead of destroying it to add it to his own fleet at the end of the battle.The game features an tutorial campaign telling the story of the first American settlers to the Independence War, a Grand Campaign which gives the player access to the whole world and several different scenarios that depict real historical battles. In addition the multiplayer mode allows for up to eight players to fight land, siege and sea battles against each other.",

At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6 tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks are unlocked as you progress through the game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial mode, against a 'ghost car' recording of your best previous lap, a lá Mario Kart 64.Gone are the entirely flat tracks of the original, having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy shapes you could imagine. One unique feature amongst almost all other racing games is the \"X\" tournament, where courses are totally randomly generated each time you start.One of the most important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 players. The various combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play.",

At certain critical points in the video, players must press certain directions on the control pad or action buttons in order to progress in the game. Fahrenheit takes this a step further by providing several buildings in which the player has the ability to move from room to room in in a non-linear fashion.

            "Description": "Far Cry 2 is an adaptation for mobile devices of the main Far Cry 2 game. The story is also similar as the player controls a mercenary in the middle of a civil war conflict in Africa. At the start of the game the player can choose between three mercenaries: Marty Alencar, Andre Hyppolite and Josip Idromeno, only different in their appearance. The main goal is to kill The Jackal, a weapons dealer who is destabilizing the war. Looking for information, the mercenary completes missions for both factions, the UFLL (United Front for Liberation and Labour) and the APR (Alliance for Popular Resistance).The character is shown from an elevated, almost top-down view with run-and-gun gameplay. The character can be moved in eight directions and also fires in the direction he is looking. There are different types of weapons such as a regular revolver, an AK-47 and a sniper rifle and it is possible to switch between them during missions. The powerful weapons have a limited amount of ammo. The game uses a cover system where the character uses obstacles for cover automatically when nearby, limiting the damage. It is also possible to vault over objects, sneak up on enemies and take them out silently with a knife. The mercenary can throw Molotov cocktails as well. There are vertically scrolling sections riding on a motorcycle, running around with a flame thrower, and also stealth missions involving silent kills and avoiding spotlights. Missions are generally split up in smaller sections with checkpoints. There is an unlimited amount of lives. Health, shown through a coloured circle surrounding the character, regenerates automatically when avoiding enemy fire. A radar in the top right corner can be used to track enemies and there is also a section where mines need to be avoided by tracking their location.The game has a certain amount of freedom as there are different villages where it is possible to move around freely, talking to characters and doing small jobs. Each village has about three missions that can be tackled in any order by selecting them from a bulletin board. There are also shops where diamonds, the reward for completing missions, can be used to buy new weapons and additional ammo. Ammo and items can also be found in levels. Some journals are hidden in missions and these can be sold in villages for diamonds.",

Players can change to any class by picking up their corresponding hat. The maps contain several structures that should be built by the workers to give ones own team an advantage - these require harvesting resources first though. An additional important feature is feeding the princess cake to make her heavier. This makes it more difficult for the other team to carry her away.The game contains other modes besides the rescue-the-princess-mode: there's a single player story mode, team deathmatch and a checkpoint-control-mode. An additional feature is the arena, where the player can fight using each class gladiator-style to survive as many levels as possible.",

Get equipment and trainers for your fighter to enhance his look and performance.Then take your fighter to career mode where you'll play fight your way up from the local gym all the way up to five-star venues. Get trainers to enhance your training and boost your speed and power. Play against randomly generated fighters all the way up through the ranks till you beat them in points or to a pulp. Certain fights may get you a bit of extra money as an incentive, or give you a promotional deal, but pick your fights carefully because strategy inside the ring won't matter if you mismanage your fisher outside.Fight smart during the fight by using the total punch control system to throw the punches you want to by using the analog stick. The total punch control system maps your fists to the analog stick getting rid of the need for senseless button mashing.You can also play in historical fights like Taylor vs. Hopkins, Gatti vs. Ward, or Robinson vs. Lamotta in the ESPN Classic mode to play in the fights that made boxing history.Once you've got the computer down for the count, you can play with any fighter or user created fighters or any of the ESPN Classic fights in local multiplayer with a friend.

            "Description": "The world is enveloped in a poisonous vapor. Anyone who comes into contact with it must die. But humans have learned to develop a technology that would help them to protect themselves from the deadly vapor. The light of Crystals shines in small villages and in large towns. But those protective Crystals have to be refilled every year with the purifying Mana Water, otherwise their energy will extinguish. Every year, villages send four youths to retrieve the Mana Water that is hidden deep in dungeons and dangerous caves. Sounds like the story of the first Final Fantasy? The plot of this first Final Fantasy game for a Nintendo console since Final Fantasy VI goes back to the roots of the series, but the gameplay has changed a lot. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is an action,  Zelda-style RPG. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of the four available character classes: magic-using Yulks, thief-like Selkies, gentle-natured Clavattes, and cute little Lilties. The game can be played with the chosen character in single-player mode, or, using the GBA-GC connection link, played with three other people, each controlling their own character.Each character has both armor and a weapon that can be replaced by crafting a new one with the appropriate items in towns. Found in each monster-filled area are artifacts that raise statistic points until the end of the area, and upon completion one artifact can be kept to raise that stat permanently. In a multiplayer game players will be given secret objectives, and by completing their objective they have a chance at claiming first dibs on artifacts at the end of the area. Spells are also found in combat areas, though they can not be taken out of them. If spells are placed next to each other in the quick select list, or cast near each other in a multiplayer game, they will merge and become a more powerful spell. Finally in single player mode a moggle will take care of holding the \"bucket\" that pushes away the toxic miasma around the party, but in a multiplayer game one of the players will have to take up this ignoble task.",

            "Description": "Final Fantasy Tactics was a big move for the whole Final Fantasy franchise into different fields. Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the 1st game during the Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system.In the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job) system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist. Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain monsters and computer controlled \"guests\" with their own jobs and special abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which leads to nearly endless combinations.The PSP version of the game mostly reiterates the original for the PSOne. Visual presentation is almost a 1:1 copy, looking like the old version with a zoomed-in camera to make it fit the PSP screen. Port developer Tose added cel-shaded introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event scenes.Also the PSP version features two new playable characters: Balthier, from Final Fantasy XII and Luso from Final Fantasy Tactics A2. Two new job classes have been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless multiplayer options available once you've reached the world map (just go into a bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is Cooperative Challenge (team mission).",

            "Description": "Though a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, the direct story links are few.  Luso is a young student ready for summer vacation, but forced to stay late and help the librarian Mr. Randell clean up.  Luso arrives in the library to find himself alone, but notices a strange-looking book with only half its pages filled.  It seems to leave off waiting for a name, so Luso provides his own.  All of a sudden he's transported to the other world of Ivalice.  From that point on his time is filled with exploring the world, trying to figure out what happened to him, and how he can return.As in the other Final Fantasy Tactics titles, gameplay is centered around a grid battle between two small parties.  Characters take turns one at a time, with order and frequency determined by their speed.  In each turn they have the chance to move as well as perform a single action; not necessarily in that order.  Battles usually end by defeating the other party, though there are occasionally other goals, such as defeating the leader or examining special spots in a stage in search of an item.  As in Tactics Advance most of the battles are optional rather than necessary to complete the story.  Battles, as well as other jobs like deliveries, can be accepted at pubs in cities.  No longer do you fight other clans directly for control of areas, but annually attempt to earn control of an area through auctions.  However, jilted clans may want to have it out with you after.In Tactics Advance, the Law system was primarily one of punishment.  If a character didn't follow the laws (Such as \"No magic\" or \"No ranged weapons\") for a given battle, they could end up in jail.  In Tactics A2, however, laws are primarily a system of benefit.  In each battle you get to pick a stat bonus from a list you earn throughout the game.  If you break one of the laws you'll lose the bonus, and fallen characters can't be revived for the remainder of the battle (though they aren't permanently lost).  You also won't get extra loot at the conclusion of the battle.This game retains Tactics Advance's Job and Ability system, where each race (hume, viera, moogle, nu mou, bangaa, seeq, and gria) has access to certain base classes, and abilities are earned by equipping an item and earning Job Points.  A difference is that even characters that don't take place in a battle will earn JP.  Certain later classes must be earned by having characters learn enough abilities in earlier classes, and/or completing certain quests from the pub.",

The king is murdered under mysterious circumstances just before signing a peace treaty with Archadia. The iron rule of the empire is established in the small country.The player takes control of a young thief named Vaan who lives in Rabanastre, the capital city of Dalmasca. Through a series of events Vaan finds himself involved in the political struggle, hoping to avenge the death of his treacherously murdered brother.Final Fantasy XII is set in Ivalice, a fantasy world which also served as a setting for Final Fantasy Tactics. The game differs from its predecessors in several core gameplay-related aspects. The game world is composed of vast areas with visibly walking enemies. There are no separate battle screens in the game; combat takes place in the same environment as exploration. Player-controlled characters can freely move during combat. Actions are still selected by choosing commands from a pop-up menu, and each character has a traditional ATB bar that determines when he or she may act; however, overall the combat resembles the \"real-time with pause\" system of Western role-playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic.The player can issue specific commands to the party members, or assign to them combat strategies (called \"gambits\" in the game). New magic, abilities, and equipment are bought from stores or found in containers in the world. Before a character can use any of these, the player has to buy a corresponding license by spending license points earned in combat. These act like skill points, and can be allocated by the player manually on the character's license board. In addition to the enemies and bosses found by following the story, the player can also accept \"Hunts\" posted in bars or offered to the player in conversations. These are optional encounters where the player has to track down and either trap or lure a very powerful monster before defeating it.",

He must guide her with his fellow mercenaries to Gallia. During the journey, the true reasons for the war are revealed.You command your units across a 3D battlefield with turn-based mechanics. Each turn, you can only move a set amount of spaces over the grid. Turns can be used to visit locations, use items or attack enemies. Each battle is stats-based and has a specific objective. You do not fight yourself, instead you control the items and weapons to influence the stats, and make use of the enemies' weaknesses. The maps have different scenarios, where you have to rescue a certain character, create distractions to move past enemies, or kill certain foes.The game is heavy on anime-styled story sequences. As with all Fire Emblem games, the characters are unique individuals that cannot be revived when they fall in battle. In order to continue with the story, only the team leaders need to survive. Characters can equip a range of weapons and possess magical abilities. Upon discovering 'hidden purposes', unique abilities can be acquired.",

The aircraft will then follow that path until it is either told otherwise, successfully lands or crashes with another aircraft subsequently ending the game. To make things more difficult, each plane or helicopter has a color and needs to land on the landing strip associated with it. Some aircraft are also faster than other ones and sometimes an emergency landing happens with a plane incoming on a predefined path that can not be altered.The game also features a multiplayer-mode for two player in which the players have to land the aircraft associated to their screen and send the ones needed by the other player to his screen.",

On the PS3, it can be moved around by tilting the SIXAXIS controller in the direction the creature should swim. The PSP version is controlled with the analogue stick. There are six, gradually unlocked creatures to choose from (Snake, Jelly, Manta, Rogue, Hunter, Credit Creature), each with their own abilities such as poison, a swirling move to draw in plankton or a homing attack. The aim of the game is to eat other micro-organisms and evolve, moving deeper into the sea until the bottom is reached, leading the game to restart with a new creature. Evolving will change the creature's shape or grants new abilities. There are different power-ups, making the creature move faster or giving it a larger mouth. Certain larger enemies are made up of dots that need to be eaten to have it destroyed, requiring different strategies to take them out.With each new level, moving deeper into the sea, the background, colours, enemies and music change. The creature is able to return to previous levels, or dive deeper, indicated by different icons. The game has straightforward controls and offers multiplayer sessions for up to 4 players, all using the same creature.flOw applies the concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment. Players can choose to ignore large and dangerous enemies or come back to fight them later, striking a balance between the game's challenges and the individual abilities.",

At the end of each level is a boss which needs to be killed to progress.Enemies that have been killed drop money. At the end of every level is a shop where you can buy weapons, armour, items and first-aid packs.",

Cars are classified as Production Cars or Race Cars divided over different classes. Every mechanical part influences the car behaviour and sound, stressing the focus on realism. There are 3 settings: Simulation (large impact of crashes), Limited (light crashes and only a small amount of damage) and Cosmetic (only visible damage, not affecting the car's performance).The game modes include a career mode with different classes, time trials, free runs and arcade races. In the career mode, winning races unlocks manufacturer relationships and you can earn money to buy new cars or customize your vehicles. This mode is expanded over Xbox Live with up to 8 human opponents. Players can buy and sell cars through the game's Auction House.",

After much deliberation, the soon-to-be conquered people of Earth devise a cunning method to quell the alien surge: challenge the freakish little globs to a game of elimination... with the Freaks as pieces.Freak Out is a fast-paced strategy game where each level takes the player to a different location, to contain the attack of the fuzzy intruders.  The playing field consists of interconnected cells, arranged in concentric squares.  The Freaks (which come in four different colors) pop out of a hatch at the center, and can be moved about by rotating and smacking them, which sends them jumping to the next cell (if it isn't occupied).  To score points and eliminate Freaks, three of the same color must be placed in adjacent cells, making them vanish in a puff of smoke.Speed is essential, since the quickly-reproducing aliens line up behind the hatch: if you let the queue get too long, it's game over.  Random items and obstacles pop up occasionally, like bonus gems, freezing ice, stone walls, or colored circles (which can only be occupied by a Freak of the same hue).  As the game advances, new challenges and mini-puzzles appear, which force the player to respond before more Freaks can be eliminated.  A password records the player's progress after every level.",

            "Description": "Yokosuka, Japan, 2112 AD. The young student Kazuki Takemura works as a test pilot with Kirishima Industries, a production company of military battle wanzers (walking panzers), mechanized walking robots with movement similar to that of a human being. Kazuki has just finished testing the combat capabilities of the new Zeinslev prototype in the lab. Finishing his day's tasks he is asked by his best friend Ryogo to help with a company delivery to the Japanese Defense Force (JDF) military based. This simple choice determines where Kazuki is when strange things begin happening in Japan. A large explosion, a wanzer theft, his sister Alysia being hunted, rumors of a powerful weapon, and accusations of involvement by agents of both the OCU and the USN all make the situation more complicated. Kazuki is swept up in a plot of conflicting loyalties and attacked by various factions. He will need to recruit additional characters and wanzers in order to be victorious in battle and investigate leads to uncover what is going on.Front Mission 3, like other games in the Front Mission Series is a turn-based strategy game featuring real-time environments, CG movies, mechanized robots and strategic battles. The game contains two independent storylines with different situations, environments and unique characters made up of different set of allies and enemies. The majority of the game takes place on the battlefield where Kazuki and his allies are controlled in an overhead view 3D environment. The game is tactical and nature, so the player chooses his unit and assigns where it will be moved and what action it will perfom. Typical actions include attacking with a shoulder weapon (missiles or gernades), attacking with a weapon held in the hand (ranged and melee), using items, guarding against future attack and simply ending the turn. As chaarcters fire weapons back and forth at each other, they will inflict damage to different parts of the wanzer. Areas that can be damaged and destroyed/disabled include arms, legs, and body. Complete damage to the body will 'destroy' the wanzer in battle, whereas disabling other parts will merely render it less effective. Each weapon has a damage type which includes (I) \"Impact\", (F) \"Flame\" and (P) \"Piercing\". In practice these types function as weapon \"elements\" which can be reduced with the proper armor coating, however it usually renders it vulnerable to another damage type. Typically Anti-I defense is very weak against Class-P attack and defending against that is weak from Class-F and defending against that is weak from Class-I. Each weapon carried by the wanzers is also classified as either Ranged, Melee, Shield or Missile . Each pilot can have a proficiency in these skills, making the usage of some weapons by them more effective than others. Pilots also learn special skills during battle, these are activated by experience points, and amount of weapon usage. Special abilities are very dependent on the types of actions being performed and items equipped, so for example the ability \"Double Shot\" requires a weapon equipped in each hand of the same weapon class.Between combat missions, Kazuki is able to save his game as well as explore the \"network\". The network is a virtual internet, allowing connections to the (completely fictional) websites of organizations involved in the Front Mission 3 plot. While exploration on the network is not required, it's exploration will uncover clues to some of the game's backstory as well as open up the opportunity to develop email contacts, obtain additional funds and unlock new wanzer gear.Between certain missions, Kazuki will enter a town. These are represented by a simple graphical menu of different locations. Areas that can be visited typically include Pubs, Wanzer Equipment Shops, Wanzer Parts Shops and specific locations. Wanzers are mix-and-matchable so that feet from one model can be attached to another and different weapons carried. Different wanzer parts each have unique values for HP, accuracy, movement and armor. However each part and weapon has a \"weight\" value, which is determined by each individual Wanzer model's engine (as well as additional parts). A wanzer is always unable to carry more than it's maximum weight. Towns are also where Kazuki will often meet new characters and have conversations to uncover the plot.",

Players can explore a 14.000 km² area of Northern America after the effects of global warming took place, rendering it desolate with abandoned cities, broken vehicles and almost no survivors. The goal is to win races, which provides fuel that can be exchanged for new vehicles. The game world is divided in nineteen separate zones that need to be unlocked by collecting stars – provided through winning career races. Up to 75 different types of vehicles can be unlocked during the course of the game. The vehicles can be modified with paint jobs and liveries.Besides the regular career races, which are restricted to a specific vehicle class like ATV, buggy or motorbike, challenges are another event type in the game. These include for example chasing a helicopter through the terrain or trying to touch other vehicles within a given time limit. Next to the races and challenges that can be accessed right away, the game also offers the ability to drive freely in each of the zones to explore the environment. This is further encouraged by having to locate new liveries, vista points, and doppler trucks that show the locations of all items. The terrain is dense and the appropriate vehicle needs to be selected to explore freely. There are many extreme weather effects, such as pouring rain, snow, thunder storms and even hurricanes.The general gameplay is arcade-like. Even though the terrain affects the performance, vehicles cannot be damaged and there is an option to respawn when crashing into objects. The roads are littered with obstacles and the game encourages to break away from the regular tracks to locate shortcuts and use jumps to cross large distances. Players can also create their own tracks through waypoints in the zone. A general HUD shows the race statistics and marks the course, along with a mini-map. FUEL can also be played online against up to 16 players.",

            "Description": "Thousands of years ago, the highly advanced precursors split into two factions: The peace-loving Arnor and the paranoid war-like Dreadlords. They fought a great war in which the outcome was that both races disappeared from the galaxy. In the year 2225, the young Human race invents the Hyperdrive and a new age of expansion blossoms throughout the civilizations of the galaxy. Each of the various races wishes to create its own empire and bring prosperity to its people. Following the events of the first game and its expansion pack, the Humans and Altarans are united in an alliance against the Dregen Empire and The Yor Collective. Victory seems assured for the Human-Altaran fleets until information surfaces about an ancient artifact which may return the Dreadlords to this universe.Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords is the sequel to the 2003 game and revisits the 4X space strategy of its predecessor. In the standard game the player will choose one of the ten major races in the game (or a custom race can be created) before setting out on an unexplored randomly-generated galactic map. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses which give it bonuses in certain areas. As well, the controlling political faction of each race assigns bonuses. With planets and resources limited, the race to conquer the galaxy begins. Planets can be colonized, resources mined and fellow civilizations befriended or destroyed. Victory can be achieved through conquest (killing all other major races), diplomacy (being allied with every remaining major race), influence (influence controls 75% of the galaxy) or technology (researching Technological victory in the tech tree). The game contains a highly customizable ship design feature allowing players to implement newly researched ship modules as they see fit. There is also a campaign mode beside the standard game, where a story of ancient Precursor civilizations unfolds mission-by-mission, and support for an online \"Metaverse\" where players can upload games to the website and be ranked against other players.",

The first was based on images, Perl and JavaScript (1998), followed by a JAVA applet version (1999) and a PHP / MySQL rendition (2000). This adaptation is the first based on the modern 2006 version of the game, initially released for Windows.This version of the game can only be played through GarageGames' InstantAction website. Originally it required tokens to play (earned through wins or by paying for them), with a limited amount of free plays per day. Later those restrictions were removed and it was supported through advertisements. Each game starts with the player in command of a number of units on a planet in a large galaxy. The goal is to conquer other planets by sending out units in an amount that exceeds the number displayed on a planet. When the amount has been met, the planet is taken over (it changes into the player's colour) and the planet starts producing units as well. Opponents follow a similar course of action, meaning there soon in a clash to take over hostile planets and defend the home ones. Players can send out ships from different planets at once, or choose to relocate them to defend against incoming attacks. To win a game, all resistance needs to be defeated.The game consists of a Practice mode, a Campaign mode with many different levels against one or multiple AI-controlled opponents, and a Quick Play mode to start a game based on a number of settings the player can define. Online multiplayer is supported for up to eight players, in free-for-all style or organized in teams. It also comes with in-game chat and a waiting lobby where the game is set up.",

            "Description": "Gears of War 2, the sequel to Gears of War, is a tactical third-person launched exclusively for the Xbox 360 as a spear point for the console's push into 2008's end-of-the-year holiday season.The game follows up six months after the events of the first game, when the detonation of the Lightmass Bomb managed to destroy most of the invading Locust army. The explosion also affected the environment however, and a disease called rustlung threatens mankind. After a while, giant holes suddenly appear that absorb entire cities at once. When Jacinto, the impenetrable safe haven for mankind, appears to await the same fate, the COG Delta Squad with protagonist Marcus Fenix has to go underground to launch a counter-offensive against the Locust who are behind the disappearances.Many known faces return to the game, as well as a cast of new support characters. There is a larger focus on the story, picking up on new threads and continuing old ones, with more attention to the history of the Locust and emotional encounters. Again, there are branching paths in certain levels. One of the stories further explored is Dominic Santiago's search for his lost wife Maria. The game's campaign mode takes the player through five acts with large-scale battles in different environments such as ruined cities, but also locations where ice or water is prominently present. During a few sequences there is also vehicular combat. The Reaver riding level for instance has on-rail shooter gameplay.The gameplay is still focused on the cover system, with the addition of new finisher moves, active reload benefits, new weapons (e.g. grenades that can be turned into proximity mines) and the ability to use enemies as meat shields. Entirely new to the game is mobile cover. There are three types of covers that can be planted at difficult sections to provide extra spots next to the regular scenery. Covers can now be deformed, but not taken away completely.Next to single-player, there is a cooperative campaign mode (split-screen or online) and each player can set a different difficulty level (based on health and damage). In the regular campaign mode, the simple controls to guide AI team mates have been removed entirely. The multiplayer portion offers fifteen maps (including remakes of existing ones). Online games offers a matchmaking system where players are matched according to their rank. Some of the new multiplayer modes are Submission (get an unfriendly AI character back to the capture point), Guardian (team deathmatch with one player is the VIP - similar to Assassination in the previous game - ; when the player is alive, the other can respawn infinitely, but - new in this mode - when he dies the other players are on their last life), Wingman (ten players are split in teams of two, both as the same character), and King of the Hill (previously only featured in the PC version of the first game).There is a cooperative Horde mode where up to five players play together in 50 waves of the Locust horde. More camera modes are present in the multiplayer games and players can take photos of the action to upload them to the official website.",

            "Description": "Just like the original game, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 is a fast, abstract shooter with glowing enemies and bullets in a rectangular arena against a black background. The game includes six game modes with different objectives. The different modes are unlocked gradually after playing the previous one for a certain amount of time.\nIn Deadline players get three minutes to score as many points as possible. This is done by destroying different waves of enemies that leave behind geoms that increase the score multiplier. The enemy ship also has a limited amount of bombs to clear the entire screen. Most other game modes feature geoms as well.\nKing is a more tactical game. Players can only shoot from circle zones that appear at random. Enemies cannot enter the zone, but they degrade over time, first becoming green and eventually red no longer blocking the enemies. The player then quickly needs to travel to a new zone and while travelling enemy crafts can only be dodged, not shot.\nEvolved is a known game mode with more traditional gameplay. Players receive four lives and three bombs to score as much as possible. For every 100,000 points an extra life and a bomb are awarded. The next bonus is awarded at ten percent of the previous value.\nPacifism is a defensive game mode where the player cannot shoot enemies. Instead they need to be dodged and can only be destroyed by flying through gates that appear at random and kill all nearby enemies. The gate constantly rotates and the player cannot touch the yellow ends.\nWaves is centered around fixed waves of orange enemies that approach from the sides of the screen as a giant wall. The player needs to make room and prevent contact. Other enemies appear as well, but in smaller amounts.\nThe final game mode is Sequence and it offers a set of twenty challenges. Per challenge, players only have 30 seconds to complete it. When a life is lost or the time is over, the game moves on to the next challenge until the player is out of lives.The later released iOS version has an additional game mode called Titans where the ship needs to fight against super-sized enemies that release a swarm of smaller enemies of the same type on death. The Xbox 360 version has cooperative and versus offline games for up to four players.",

While the originals were set within Greek mythology, the new title takes place after the original games within the world of Norse mythology. Kratos now resides in Midgard along with his son Atreus. After encountering a mysterious stranger covered in tattoos, Kratos and Atreus set out on a long and dangerous journey through the Nine Realms to scatter his dead wife's ashes from atop the highest mountain peak in Midgard.Unlike the original games, God of War utilizes a freely controllable third-person camera. Kratos now makes use of the Leviathan Axe, which has frost-damaging capabilities to freeze enemies in place, and can be thrown and summoned back to Kratos' hand at will. Kratos also has a shield that can be used to block and parry incoming attacks. Kratos can also use his fists to attack enemies, this can stun enemies and allows Kratos to execute finishing moves. In addition, his son Atreus can fire arrows at enemies and summon animals. Attacking enemies and collecting certain items raises Kratos' rage meter. After it is full, Kratos can use Spartan Rage, which greatly increases his attack power and speed, making him virtually unstoppable for a short time. In addition to combat, Kratos can also use the axe for puzzle solving, by freezing certain mechanisms in place, or destroying runes to unlock chests.Exploration and combat yield experience points and silver. Both are used to upgrade Kratos' and Atreus' abilities, granting new combos or increasing attack power. Gear can be purchased and upgraded at shops to grant stat boosts to Kratos in an RPG-like fashion. Gear can also be further enhanced with enchantments.The game takes place in a semi-linear world that allows for some degree of exploration and backtracking, and offers a number of side actvities and tasks.",

Chains of Olympus is a prequel set ten years before the original God of War. Gameplay is similar to the predecessors but with some minor changes. Kratos goes through levels killing enemies and bosses, solving box-based puzzles and doing quick time events. He also collects red orbs to power up his weapons and abilities, Gorgon eyeballs to increase his health and Phoenix feathers to increase his magic power.The game's controls were adjusted to fit the PSP's reduced amount of buttons. Both the shoulder buttons and the analog stick are now required in order to dodge. The most well-known God of War weapon, the Blades of Chaos, are also present. There are several new weapons and magic spells available, including Sun Shield, Efreet spell and Light of Dawn. The game starts when the Gods send Kratos to the city of Attica to defend it from the invading Persian army. But later when Morpheus strikes, Kratos will need to use all his power to save the world once again.",

            "Description": "The brutal warrior Kratos returns as the new vengeful God of War. The second chapter of the series focuses once more on a tale of revenge. Having defeated Ares and now a god himself, Kratos proves to be a more vicious and power-hungry god than Ares ever was. Eventually he finds himself betrayed, with his godly powers and abilities removed from him.  Kratos sets upon another epic quest to find the Sisters of Fate and do what no mortal or god has ever done: change his destiny and reclaim his power.Like its predecessor, God of War II is an action game with platforming and puzzle-solving elements. Still utilizing the Blades of Chaos, Kratos must rip apart his enemies and and other gods, heroes, and monsters from the Greek myths that stands in his way to revenge and power. As before, the higher the combo achieved from killing an enemy, the more red orbs will be awarded to Kratos for upgrades. Kratos has a selection of spells which utilize the blue orbs.  Some are familiar from the previous game, while others are new to the sequel and its storyline.In addition to the action and light puzzle-solving, Kratos takes to the sky in the sequel with some rail-based flying levels on the back of either a Pegasus or gryphon. He also learns several new abilities for combat as well as for solving the puzzles in the game, such as for example the ability to slow down time.Included with the game is a second disc that has such bonus features as deleted levels, the voices of God of War II, the musical score, and a documentary about bringing the game to life.",

            "Description": "This version of GoldenEye 007 takes the concept behind the original  N64 exclusive and moves not only the gameplay forward to the modern era, but also fast-forwards the Bond franchise to the new guy.  Pierce Brosnan's Bond will likely forever remain an N64 exclusive, as Daniel Craig's Bond takes the reigns. This GoldenEye isn't so much a remake or a port as it is, as Hollywood says when spinning a \"remake,\" a reboot of the classic title.Essentially, the game is a revamp of the GoldenEye story, which has James Bond fighting to stop a rogue Russian General from unleashing the powerful GoldenEye weapon. What this release brings to the table is the grittier nature of Craig's James Bond.  Many story elements have been modernized as well: for instance, character motivations have been updated and Bond's tech-filled watch from the original movie and game has been replaced by a do-all cell phone.  Character designs have been updated as well.This version is more in-line with its contemporary FPS titles in the dual-analog style. Like the original, it emphasizes stealth and espionage-oriented gameplay, allowing more than one way to complete missions. However, the game also contains third-person vehicular elements, such as the tank chase sequence from the film.  The game retains the split-screen multiplayer mayhem the original title was known for, and again modernizes things with online gameplay for up to eight players.  Like the earlier game, characters from the main game appear in multiplayer as well as classic Bond villains including infamous characters Jaws, Scaramanga (the man with the Golden Gun) and Oddjob. Overall, the game features fifty playable characters for the multiplayer experience, ten maps, three gameplay modes, and seventeen \"modifiers.\"  \n",

The level is a top-down view, with the player's ship and shield on one side and the aliens on the other side; this level bears the most resemblance to Space Invaders.The second level called Laser Attack is made up of a formation of ships, with some that swoop down and a laser that fires at the player's ship. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.The third level is called Galaxians, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game Galaxian with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.The fourth level called Space Warp, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view. One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.The fifth and final level is called Flag Ship. In this level, the player does not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one which happens to be a large Flag Ship with a  weak spot which is its core. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it, but the player must first shoot through a similar shield that the player had in the first level.\nFinishing the game increases the player's rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.",

The \"Day of Darkness\" will someday occur, heralding the resurrection of Valmar.Ryudo is a \"GeoHound\", a mercenary available for hire, usually for slaying monsters and recovering goods. Working with a talking bird named Skye, who sites on Ryudo's shoulder, they will \"do anything\" if the price is right  One day Ryudo receives a job from a branch of the Church of Granas, they ask Ryudo to become a bodyguard for a young priestess named Elena during a prayer ceremony. During the ceremony, strange events occur requiring Ryudo to escort Elena on a journey towards the Grandia 2 is a 3D RPG, viewed from a top-down perspective for most of the game and a 3rd person view during battle. Controlling Ryudo, the player will explore various locations, locating townspeople and objects within an area to interact with. Towns and dungeons are displayed in the same manner, though dungeons tend to be mazes filled with monsters and towns tend to be friendly areas filled instead with conversation and shops. Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around. Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle. If the monster notices the player approaching it is considered a normal battle, if Ryudo is able to approach undetected the player's party will gain the initiative in battle, if any party member besides Ryudo is approached by the enemy then the party loses initiative.In battle, each character is able to choose from a list of actions that include \"attack combos\" (standard attack command), Special Abilities/Magic, \"Critical Strike\", Guard, Evade and Escape. Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they can block an enemy's action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar, displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character (and enemy's) time to act within the battle.  Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character's individual movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen. Successfully defeating enemies in battle awards experience points, power points, magic points, gold and items. ",

After his father's assassination, Huang flies in from China to deliver a ceremonial sword to his uncle Wu \"Kenny\" Lee to ensure the inheritance of the Triad bosses. However, shortly after his arrival he is jumped, shot, robbed and left for dead, only to survive and vow his vengeance for his father and recover the lost sword to bring honor back to his family.While being a mission-based game in the vein of the 3D Grand Theft Auto installments, Chinatown Wars returns to use the more traditional top-down while using a new cel-shaded 3D Engine. Many of the features from the more recent GTA games have been included, such as the safehouse, where the protagonist can read e-mails from other characters in the game and store cars and items. There is also a programmable GPS system that helps players find their way in the Liberty City more easily. A replay feature is also present that allows players to replay previous missions by accessing these through their safehouses. While the protagonist can make money by completing missions, he can also engage in drug trading with numerous dealers scattered throughout Liberty City. There are many drugs to choose from including cocaine, heroin, acid, and weed among others; it is possible to buy them cheap and sell them to other dealers by checking their market value through the PDA.  From time to time, an e-mail will be sent to the protagonist that will tip him off of dealers that are either selling drugs at a cheap price or buying them at above average market prices. However, the player must also be aware that buying in bulk will attract the attention of the police after the deal has been done, causing the main character's star level to instantly rise. If the protagonist is caught, he will lose all the drugs that he is carrying. It is possible to carjack drug vans (which are indicated by a red arrow above them), return them to the safehouse and search them for either drugs or cash.  Weapons can be obtained by hijacking Amm-u-nation trucks, but the trucks are heavily-armored and their drivers armed.Police chases have been changed in this installment.  While it still features a star level, there is also an icon that resembles cop cars.  While players can still resort to Pay 'n Spray shops to change the look of the car to throw off the authorities, they can also wreck any pursuing police car, crossing out the car icon.  If the cop car icons for that level are dropped, their star level will drop as well.The DS version utilizes the system's capabilities such as using the stylus pen as a screwdriver to turn the car's ignition, or taking a plate off in the car and using the stylus to hotwire it.  The pen can also be used to scratch off lottery games in stores scattered around in the game, as well as throw explosive devices such as grenades and molotov cocktails or even smash objects such as security panels or a windshield of a car when the player goes into the water while in a vehicle. The microphone can also be used by blowing into it to hail an approaching on-duty taxi. This version also supports Nintendo WFC for statistics uploading to the Rockstar Social Club and multi-play gaming.The PSP version adds several new missions, as well as new radio stations. Where the touch screen is used on the DS, the PSP version instead uses the analog stick. ",

            "Description": "The Lost and Damned is the first expansion pack for Grand Theft Auto IV. It has been made available as DLC (downloadable content) and requires the original game to play.Set in Liberty City, just like the original game, there is a new storyline with a new protagonist, Johnny Klebitz. He is vice-president of the biker gang The Lost Motorcycle Club. While the president Billy Grey is in rehab, he takes over and tries to work out deals with the other gangs. When Grey eventually returns he resorts to his violent tactics, making it difficult to keep it running. Billy and Johnny clash for the leadership, while dealing with the other gangs, especially Angels of Death. The original game is not ignored however, as Niko Bellic not only appears in the game, but even becomes an important part of the storyline. Parts of the actions in the game are also influenced by the events in the original game, suggesting that both stories happen around the same time.The game starts in a club house in Alderney, in the Western part of the city where Niko only got access late in the game. The entire city is available at once. Contrary to the first game and in the spirit of the biker gang Johnny's in, there is much more focus on team work with the other members. Their health bars are also shown on the screen. When a member dies in action, he needs to be replaced by a less experienced youngster, making it harder to progress and encouraging the player to look after his peers. There are also strict rules in the gang, especially when riding around in a set formation is required. Members can be called to provide weapons and stealing other vehicles is less encouraged. Johnny starts on a custom bike that is virtually indestructible, though it can be replaced. Most of the new vehicles are bikes, but there are also a few new trucks and vans.The clubhouse offers new minigames such as arm wrestling, pool and card games. There are new sites on the internet, new TV shows and three new radio stations with a focus on hard rock. Next to the regular storyline there are challenges based on racing or gang wars. The new weapons are a grenade launcher, an assault shotgun, a pool cue, a pipe bomb and an automatic 9mm.Six new multiplayer modes are introduced: races, club business, lone wolf biker (Full Throttle and Chopper Vs. Chopper), witness protection, and gang war.",

The player takes control of Carl Johnson (C.J.), who had moved to Liberty City in order to distance itself from his past as a member of a gang in his home city, San Andreas. But the past catches up with him in a way he had not imagined: he finds out that his mother was killed by a rival gang. He goes back to San Andreas to attend her funeral. Realizing how corrupted local police is, seeing how his relatives and friends need him, determined to avenge his mother's death, C. J. has no other choice but revert to his old ways.Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is the fifth game in the GTA series. The basic premise remains the same: roam the \"sandbox\" environments, hijack cars, and complete missions to advance the story. The game's world is significantly larger than in its two immediate predecessors, encompassing three cities and a vast countryside between them, with smaller towns, mountains, rivers, and other places of interest. The interactivity with the environment is enhanced, since the player character can now swim and dive, being able to access every corner of the game world.The missions vary in structure and gameplay, including chases, races, longer and more intense third-person shooter sequences, as well as a wide variety of vehicles to navigate, which range from different new types of cars (such as lowriders), bicycles, motorcycles, to boats, helicopters, planes, trains, and exotic devices such as monster trucks and jetpacks. Some of the missions involve recruiting gang members and attacking turfs belonging to rival gangs.As in the previous games, there are many activities to perform outside of the missions. Working as a taxi driver, taking part in races, delivering sick people to hospital, etc., return from the preceding games in the series. San Andreas adds many new activities of its own, some of them with a role-playing flavor. C.J. can go to gym and work out, increasing his stamina. From time to time he has to eat - though overeating will make him look fatter. He is also able to have romantic relationships with certain female characters, asking them out on a dinner, giving them presents, etc.",

In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets.

The Land of the Dead is where all people are reincarnated after death, turning into skeletal figures. The Land of the Dead is also very similar to the world of the living: people work, have careers, fall in love, and can even die again, turning into flowers. And they all await their final destiny - a trip to the underworld. Depending on their deeds in life, they might get a good journey or be destined to walk there without any means. Manny works in a travel agency that takes care of such trips. But recently, something has been going wrong. Manny is unable to get good clients, and he suspects that there is a scheme to falsify the dossiers of dead people, offering the best trips to scoundrels for bribes. Manny's grand adventure begins as he steps into the world of corruption and intrigues.Grim Fandango is a puzzle-solving adventure game that describes several years of Manny Calavera's afterlife. Influenced by Mexican mythology, film noir and Art Deco, the game combines 3D characters with pre-rendered backgrounds. The traditional mouse interaction was abandoned in favor of keyboard control for movements and actions. Manny is navigated with arrow keys, and tilts his head whenever something attracts his interest; the object or character in question can then be examined or interacted with.As usually in LucasArts' adventure games, conversations offer plenty of different responses that can be chosen by the player. Despite the lack of the option to combine items with each other within the inventory, the game still contains many challenging puzzles that require manipulating inventory items and the environment.",

To survive a level the fish has to eat all other fishes in the water. It can only eat fishes that are smaller than itself, but the more it eats the more it grows until it is large enough to eat any fish. The player can pick up bubbles to get power-ups. This include for example temporary growth and speed increases. Eaten fish drop coins that can be used in a shop to buy power-up upgrades. Movement can be done in three different ways, tilting the device, using a virtual joystick, or by touch and move. Two game mode exist. The adventure mode consists of 64 levels in seven different locations, from a small jug to the vast oceans. The goal here is simply to advance to the next level and unlock more locations. The other mode is survival where the player simply has to stay alive as long as possible. A high score can the be uploaded to an online ranking. ",

            "Description": "Ages ago, the spirits of Earth and Sky waged war on each other. Neither could win, and eventually the Sky Spirits bestowed some humans with their powers, turning them into wizards and allies in the war. The Earth Spirits were banished into darkness; but the Sky Spirits feared the human wizards and cast them underground as well.Years have passed, and a powerful wizard named Kanon escaped from the gloomy prison and turned the human land into a puppet state trembling before his might. One legendary sword is said to bring an end to Kanon's reign. Four warriors - Han, Randy, Nicole and Ginjirou - retrieved the sword, but knights sent by Kanon are determined to take it away and destroy it at all costs. Aided by the renegade knight Serena, the four heroes must keep the world safe and protect themselves against the onslaught.Guardian Heroes is a hybrid of a side-scrolling beat-em-up and a role-playing game. The four initial player characters are distinguished by their attributes and abilities: Han is a strong fighter who cannot use magic; Randy is a sorcerer who can cast attack spells but is physically more vulnerable; Ginjirou is a ninja-type, agile character; finally, Nicole has weak attacks but can cast healing spells.The fighting mechanic is slightly deeper than in most other games of this type, with light and heavy attacks, special moves (executed the same way as usually in fighting games), magical attacks and the ability to block. Defeating enemies yields experience points, with which the player can upgrade the characters between levels, sharing them between various factors such as strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.The game has a branching storyline that develops according to the player's selection of stages. There is also a \"Karma\" system that evaluates the player's actions depending on how he or she treats enemies or innocent people in the game world.Even in one-player mode there are always two controllable characters on screen - the player commands the other character by changing his \"mood\" - aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six. On top of this, it is possible to play the game as a more traditional beat-em-up with up to six players (human or AI-controlled); in this mode it is possible to play as any character encountered during the main game mode.",

            "Description": "Guild Wars: Prophecies (renamed after the release of Guild Wars: Factions) sets players in the fantasy world of Tyria.When creating a character, the player has to choose whether they want to create a Role-Playing character or a PvP-character and what character class they want to play (Warrior, Ranger, Elementalist, Mesmer, Necromancer or Monk).Role-Playing:Shortly prior to the game start, the three human kingdoms of Tyria - Ascalon, Kryta and Orr, fought each other in many guild wars. The last guild war abruptly ends when the Charr began to overrun the weakened kingdoms.The Charr, a violent race from the north (whose homeland can be visited in Guild Wars: Eye of the North) began an invasion of the kingdoms of Tyria. Kryta's expelled Saul D'Alessio and his White Mantle repelled the invasion, Orr was annihilated when Vizier Khilbron cast a forbidden spell to protect the capital city of Arah resulting in the Cataclysm and the sinking of the kingdom to the ground of the Sea of Sorrows, what still stands is the Kingdom of Ascalon protected by their Great Northern Wall.The player starts at the day of, and just some hours prior to, the \"Great Searing\", the Charr ritual that turned the green lands of Ascalon into a wasteland. At the beginning of that day, Ascalon looks for heroes help fighting the Charr and here is where the game starts.In this tutorial area, the player can play alone or with another player, to complete the first quests, acquire the first skills and get in touch with the game world. After choosing a secondary profession, the player can leave the tutorial and start the \"real\" game.Note: choosing a secondary profession is a crucial part in the design of Guild Wars, as the player does not play just a monk or a warrior, but a combination of the professions. With the six character classes, Prophecies effectively has 30 different character combinations.For example, while a Elementalist/Mesmer (E/Me) and a Mesmer/Elementalist (Me/E) might look similar, the differences are that the armor can only be used for the primary profession and each profession has a primary attribute which only this class can use. As an Elementalist, the E/Me has Energy Storage increasing the available energy drastically. While the Me/E has base energy, they can cast spells twice as fast because of their Fast Cast.The secondary profession is locked for about 75% of the Prophecies game, but can later be changed unlimited times. (With access to Factions and/or Nightfall even much earlier.)After leaving the tutorial, the player can play many side quests (to gain experience, gold and skills), primary quests (which lead to missions) and missions itself (which advance the story). Prophecies offers 25 missions (with primary and secondary (bonus) objectives) to play and hundreds of quests with many plot twists on various game settings (wasteland, green lands, jungle, dessert, snowy mountains, volcanic islands).The player also has access to all PvP content while reaching those outposts in the storyline. Each skill acquired, each rune or weapon upgrade identified will be unlocked on the account for use with PvP-only-characters.The game would is fully instanced, means each player (or a group of players) get their own area/mission \"copy\" from the server. While no one can join you while the player(s) is/are adventuring, no one will \"steal/corrupt\" you a boss or missing objective you try to reach. Each enemy slain in an area keep dead (don't respawn) unless they are resurrected per skill like the own group can do it with their own team members.Furthermore, the game is almost only played in teams, as the game area are balanced for the maximum size of a team (2, 4, 6 or 8 players). Therefore you can either play co-op or with the lack of human players, fill in with NPC henchmen.The game has a level cap of 20 and easily obtainable max-level armor and weapons with the design of getting \"better looking\" stuff instead of weapons with ever increasing damage, and increasing the difficulty as the players have to deploy tactics as the enemies aren't capped at level 20 nor are they limited to groups of 8.For those that \"played through the campaign\", Prophecies offers four \"elite mission\" like areas: The Fissure of Woe, The Underworld, Sorrow's Furnace and The Tomb of the Primeval Kings (the last once was a PvP outpost prior to the release of Factions).Finally, the game offers titles to display achievements the character (or the whole account) has made, like exploring the entire map (Grandmaster Cartographer), capping all elite skills (Skill Hunter), beating the missions in normal and hard difficulty (Protector/Guardian) or even \"cleaning\" an area of all enemies (Vanquisher), and much more. All these achievements can be displayed in Eye of the North's Hall of Monuments.PvP-character:When creating a PvP-character, this character is always at level 20 and has max-level armor and weapons. They can be fully customized with all the skills, runes and weapon upgrades available at the account (unlocked via PvE or PvP itself).PvP-characters starting at the Isle of the Nameless, a PvP tutorial with all the stuff the player needs (testing weapon ranges, different armor class targets, etc.).PvP mechanics applying to both character types:After each enemy kill in an arena or for winning it, the player cumulates Balthazar faction (named after Guild Wars's God of War and Fire), with this skills, runes, upgrades and heroes (the latter one requires an account combination with Nightfall and/or Eye of the North) can be unlocked and therefore used in PvP. The following \"arenas\" are present in Prophecies (for PvE and PvP characters):\nAscalon Arena - 4vs4 Team - PvE-only (level 1 to 10)\nShiverpeak Arena - 4vs4 Team - PvE-only (level 1 to 15)\nRandom Arena - 4vs4 at random\nTeam Arena - 4vs4 Team\nHeroes' Ascent - 8vs8 Team Tournament, 8vs8vs8 at final map\nHero Battles - 1vs1 human players, each with 3 Heroes (requires an account combination with Nightfall and/or Eye of the North)\nGuild vs. Guild (GvG) - 8vs8 Team\nSimilar to pure PvE-achievements, the PvP content also has titles for achievements for winning in PvP. In addition, GvG and Hero Battles also featuring ladder play.Final note: all the Guild Wars campaigns - including Prophecies - have, despite being a MMORPG, no subscription fees.\nThe Game of the Year Edition (also known as 1 Million Edition) provided seven special weapons (Luminescent Scepter, Nevermore Flatbow, Rhino's Charge, Serrated Shield, Soul Shrieker, Tiger's Roar, Wolf's Favor), which can be created as many times as needed, but are bound at the character who created them.The Guild Wars Prophecies 2008 release adds the Igneous Summoning Stone (which summons a Fire Imp which helps players levelling to level 20) on top of the GOTYE items.",

The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.The music selection consists of 28 master recordings and 21 additional songs by others selected by the band. Bonus features include various videos and trivia about the songs. Progress is made by completing sets of songs, rather than a series of gigs as in Guitar Hero: World Tour, set in venues that were in important in the band's career. Performances are rated with stars and a certain amount is needed to progress and unlock a new set.The game also includes the GHTunes from World Tour where new songs can be created and shared. A new Drum Mode offers the possibility to play the drums without an existing drum track to create new rhythms, and the Battle mode (from Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock), has been updated with Metallica influences for the power-ups, with names like Fade To Black, Under The Ice and Ride The Lightning.Although released in Europe packaged with a guitar controller and Metallica faceplate, other regions were not so fortunate and only received a solus edition. Custom drumsticks and a second bass pedal were offered as pre-order bonuses in certain stores.The Metallica tracklist includes:\nAll Nightmare Long\nBattery\nBroken, Beat &amp; Scarred\nCreeping Death\nCyanide\nDisposable Heroes\nDyers Eve\nEnter Sandman\nFade to Black\nFight Fire with Fire\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls\nFrantic\nFuel\nHit the Lights\nKing Nothing\nMaster of Puppets\nThe Memory Remains\nMercyful Fate (Medley)\nMy Apocalypse\nNo Leaf Clover (Live)\nNothing Else Matters\nOne\nOrion\nSad But True\nSeek &amp; Destroy\nThe Shortest Straw\nThe Thing That Should Not Be\nThe Unforgiven\nWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\nWherever I May Roam\nWhiplashThe guest tracklist includes:\nAlice in Chains - No Excuses\nBob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band - Turn the Page (Live)\nCorrosion of Conformity - Albatross\nDiamond Head - Am I Evil?\nFoo Fighters - Stacked Actors\nJudas Priest - Hell Bent for Leather\nKyuss - Demon Cleaner\nLynyrd Skynyrd - Tuesday's Gone\nMachine Head - Beautiful Mourning\nMastodon - Blood and Thunder\nMercyful Fate - Evil\nMichael Schenker Group - Armed and Ready\nMotörhead - Ace of Spades\nQueen - Stone Cold Crazy\nSamhain - Mother of Mercy\nSlayer - War Ensemble\nSocial Distortion - Mommy's Little Monster (Live)\nSuicidal Tendencies - War Inside My Head\nSystem of a Down - Toxicity\nThe Sword - The Black River\nThin Lizzy - The Boys Are Back in Town\nMetallica songs of the Death Magnetic album bought for previous versions are incorporated into the game.",

He has cast a spell that will destroy the world in exactly 30 seconds, and an intrepid young hero is the only one who can defeat him. This hero has made a pact with the Time Goddess, protector of time, which allows him to level up extremely quickly and turn back time (for a nominal fee, naturally). He must defeat the dark lord before the spell can be completed...but of course, there's always another one waiting to take their place.Half-Minute Hero is an extremely fast-paced Japanese-style RPG. In the main game mode, Hero 30, each quest requires the player to gather items and equipment, level up, complete story events, and ultimately reach and defeat the boss, all before the strict 30-second time limit expires. There are several dozen missions to play through, each with their own unique location and scenario.In addition to the main Hero 30 mode, there are also several other modes included in Half-Minute Hero, all of which feature the same strict 30-second time limit:Dark Lord 30 casts the player as a reformed dark lord who punishes evil for the sake of his love. His game is a real-time strategy game where the player can summon various monsters and cast spells to defeat enemies.\nPrincess 30 sees the player take control of a young princess who must leave the castle to find medicine for her sick father, the king. Her game plays as a scrolling shooter.\nKnight 30 puts the player in the role of a knight who must protect a Sage as he casts a spell to clear the area of monsters. His game is an action game much like a tower defense game.As the game is played, a gallery fills with all the items and enemies the player encounters, as well as with many pieces of production artwork. There is also an ad-hoc multiplayer mode where up to four heroes can race to see who can defeat the dark lord the fastest.",

            "Description": "In the sequel to Halo, Spartan-117, better known as the Master Chief, has returned to Earth, where he is promptly needed: despite all precautions taken, the Covenant have discovered the location of humanity's homeworld and are launching their attack. For some reason, however, their fleet is much smaller than expected. To solve this mystery, the Chief must return to the stars, learning more about the mysterious Halo rings and their constructors.Meanwhile, the Covenant Elite who commanded the fleet at the Halo construct is blamed for the destruction of the ring and branded a heretic. The High Prophets grant him another chance, however: he is made the Arbiter, a special operative for the Prophets, ordered to carry out impossible missions. He will be dealing with dissent and rebellion among the Covenant - a conflict where he might find himself to be on the wrong side.The player controls both the Chief and the Arbiter in Halo 2, a first-person-shooter in the same style as the first game. Its main gameplay characteristics are the same: only two weapons can be carried at a time (leading to a tactical choice as to which are to be taken), instead of a standard health points system there is the recharging energy shield (leading to an emphasis on finding cover during firefights), AI-controlled teammates will fight along the protagonist, and there are lots of sections involving vehicles.New features include the ability to double-wield certain weapons, doubling the firing rate at the expense of accuracy and the ability to execute melee attacks or throw grenades. Part of the weapon arsenal is unchanged from the first game, but there are also some additions. The human projectile weapons are mostly new and include a pistol, shotgun, SMG and battle rifle. Returning are the sniper rifle and the rocket launcher. The Covenant energy-based weapons (still prone to overheating) from Halo all return, and new additions include several heavy hitters like the Brute Shot and Fuel Rod Gun along with the projectile-based Carbine and the Beam Rifle, both useful for sniping. The Energy Sword is a powerful melee weapon, able to kill most enemies with a single strike.All vehicles from the original game also return: Warthog jeeps and Scorpion tanks for the Humans, Banshee fliers, Ghost gliders and Wraith tanks for the Covenant. A new addition is the Covenant Spectre, which with its rear-mounted cannon wielded by a dedicated gunner is comparable to the Warthog. A new player ability concerning vehicles is to board them while in use and either kick off the driver and take over, or in the case of heavy tanks, throwing in a grenade.The multiplayer component of the game has been greatly expanded. On the Xbox, Xbox Live is now supported in addition to split screen and system link. The campaign can be played by two players in split screen. Competitive game types include Slayer and Team Slayer (standard free-for-all deathmatch), Capture the Flag, Assault (planting a bomb in the enemy base), Territories (controlling sections of a map for a certain amount of time), Oddball (finding a skull on the map and then holding on to it as long as possible) and more. All types have several built-in variants and can also be customized further. Players can choose from Spartan and Covenant Elite skins. The PC version comes with a map editor.",

            "Description": "Halo 3 is the third game in the main Halo series.  Like the rest of the series, it is a sci-fi/military-themed first-person shooter with an emphasis on vehicles and an extensive multiplayer mode in addition to the single-player campaign.As before, the series' signature shield system is used where, rather than health, you have a force field of sorts which loses power as you are attacked.  You needn't pick up anything to refill it, only take cover for several seconds.  If you can avoid being attacked, the shield will recharge on its own.Vehicles are again present.  These are human and alien transport which can be driven or ridden in with another player or AI doing the driving.  Halo 3 adds numerous new types of vehicles, notably a massive mobile command center called the Elephant and a human VTOL aircraft called the Hornet.  Enemies with good timing can board a vehicle, kicking out the occupant.Also as before, you are limited to one weapon in hand (or one in each hand for some of the smaller guns) and one on back-up with both human and alien weapons available.  Weapons can be fired or used to club someone for a melee hit.  There are several new weapons, including the gravity hammer, which is a massive hammer for one-hit kills in close combat.  When using a single weapon, your second trigger throws grenades, which have a new spike type in addition to the basic sticky and frag ones from previous games.  Turrets are back, which are mounted guns with a new missile pod variant and the added ability to rip them off their moorings and carry them around in 3rd person view.There is a new feature called equipment where you get objects with particular effects, such as a gravity lift, a shield drain field, a shield recharge field, land mines and a bubble shield which can be penetrated by players, but not gunfire.  One piece of equipment can be carried at a time and it can be deployed anywhere.All the multiplayer game types from Halo 2 are back.  This includes the standard fps games like slayer (essentially deathmatch), capture the flag, assault (reverse ctf), territories and king of the hill (territories with a single point).  There are also Halo-specific games, like oddball, where you must hold an object the longest time and juggernaut, where one player gets specials powers.  Only they can score points.  If you kill that player, you become the juggernaut.  Two new games are added: VIP, where you are tasked with killing a specific player on the other team and must protect your own VIP, and infection, which is a human team vs a zombie team and humans are infected and brought to the other team as they are killed.  There are also dozens of variants of these, such as crazy king, which is king of the hill with a moving hill, mad dash which is a juggernaut games where the object is to get to waypoint instead of kill people and single-weapon versions of slayer.  You can make your own custom game types by manipulating a a number of variables such as weapons, goals and player stats.This is augmented by Forge, which is a map editor.  While it doesn't have the ability to change level geometry, Forge can be used to completely change object placements.  This is not only weapons and vehicles and power-ups, but spawn points, crates, fusions coils (exploding barrels), etc.  The map editor is actually a playable game mode with some players becoming the monitor and placing objects for use by their teammates.  They can give give them a tank, for instance, or create a barrier and levitate it along as mobile cover.The campaign mode contains a number of new features as well.  The players now control distinct characters in co-op rather than the Chief just having an identical twin, the player limit has been expanded to four and it is now playable online.  There is a metagame where you score points in the campaign (used for some of the achievements) and the skulls from Halo 2 have been expanded with a checklist and additional features, such as unlocking extra armor for use in multiplayer and additional dialogue featured throughout the game.The ability to customize your appearance has been expanded from Halo 2 with not only a longer list of emblems to place on your armor and the ability to pick a third color, but multiple armor variants which can be mixed and matched and the ability to use a female voice.Other new features include a theater where you can re-watch games you or others played from the viewpoint of any player-character or in third-person or with a free camera.  You have the ability to save films for posterity, take screenshots or edit films for highlight reels or machinima (multiplayer only).  This is a multiplayer feature, so you can watch films with people in your online party.All of these things (edited maps, custom games, films and screenshots) can be put in a new file-sharing feature and are accessible to other players or through any PC via the internet.",

It marks the return of the surgically enhanced super soldier or \"Spartan\" Master Chief, John-117, as a playable protagonist for the first time since 2007's Halo 3, who'd been considered dead or missing in action by Covenant and UNSC forces since the end events of that game.The game sets the stage for a new story in which Master Chief returns to confront his destiny and face an ancient awakened evil that threatens all life in the universe. The main campaign also heavily explores the relationship between Master Chief and his AI companion, Cortana. Cortana is nearing the end of her life, before devolving into a state called Rampancy in which an AI begins to think itself to death. The campaign features both first-person shooter and driving elements, and can be played either single player or co-cooperatively (either over Xbox Live or split-screen). It features new weapons and an entirely new class of enemy characters called Prometheans.  The game also features a reach multiplayer experience called Infinity. The centerpiece of this experience is the UNSC Infinity, the largest starship ever built by humanity. The player controls a personalized Spartan IV which, as the player competes in multiplayer sessions, gains experience and unlocks new abilities, armor customizations, and weapons. Play is divided between two modes: Wargames and Spartan Ops.  War Games is the traditional Halo PVP experience, but couched as training simulations for all the Spartans on board the infinity.  In addition to classic modes such as Team Slayer and Capture the Flag, War Games also features some new modes, such as Regicide and Flood.Spartan Ops is an episodic cooperative campaign which contains ten episodes, in which the player players as their Spartan IV character. Spartan Ops is set 6 months after the end of the campaign and continues the adventures of the Infinity's Crew.  Each episode is released weekly and contains a new cinematic along with 5 new missions to complete. These missions can be completed solo, but are designed to be played cooperatively, again over Xbox Live or split-screen.",

            "Description": "Humanity is the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant who have been wiping out colony after colony. You hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol make a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.Halo: Combat Evolved is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.Only two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on back-up.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.Your life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item than is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.One of most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies.  Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.Halo also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.",

Now, despite the UNSC's best efforts to keep its location secret, the alien alliance known as 'The Covenant' have located it and launched a full scale offensive against Reach.

With Covenant forces systematically taking over Reach, you must fend them off.New to Halo: Reach are reusable tech abilities. They are similar to the single use abilities featured in Halo 3 and Halo ODST, and also feature new abilities such as decoy holograms, active camouflage and jet packs. The map Editor Forge is also featured, and allows players to create their own multiplayer maps. Players can now also choose their choice of armour when they spawn into multiplayer games.The game's multiplayer element has retained several of the previous game modes from other Halo games including Slayer and King of The Hill, as well as adding several new modes: Headhunter drops several skulls into a map and players pick them up and drop them off for points. Stockpile has teams collecting flags and keeping hold of them and scoring points for every minute they have them. Generator Defense has a team of three Spartans defending power generators from a group of Covenant Elites who must destroy them, and Invasion which pits six Spartans against six Elites, with the elites fighting for a navigational core, and the Spartans must keep them from getting it.",

When the ambitious enemy king Bohan threatens the clan, the Heavenly Sword falls into Nariko's hands. She has to wield it to protect her people, but also has to bear its curse, as it drains the life force of those who use it.Heavenly Sword is a third-person action game with a focus on melee combat similar to the God of War series. In most of the game, Nariko engages the enemy using the Heavenly Sword to execute spectacular feats of martial arts and swordsmanship. The Heavenly Sword can be used in three different fighting stances: Speed Stance for quick hack-and-slash attacks, Range Stance for attacking enemies at a distance, and Power Stance for slow, powerful attacks. During certain sequences Quick Time Events need to be completed as well. Players will also take control of Nariko's adopted sister, a cat-like girl named Kai, whose crossbow can be used as a long-range sniper weapon.  In this and other sequences (such as holding off a huge enemy army with a giant cannon), the player can use the SIXAXIS motion sensor to apply aftertouch to the projectiles, guiding them to their targets in slow motion.Fighting enemies relies often on counter attacks. Nariko has access to a large amount of combos for each stance, but only a few of them can break guard. Attacks of stronger enemies highlight them in a colour and Nariko has to block, done automatically by not attacking, by choosing the correct stance. Blue is blocked with Speed, yellow with Power and red attacks are unblockable. The latter are avoided by evading using the right analog stick. Most of the new combos are unlocked by collecting glyphs. These are stored in pots throughout levels and also refill health, but many are awarded based on the player's performance. At the end of every section, up to three glyph symbols can be earned, by not getting hit or countering a lot of attacks. Nariko also has a number of counter moves that need to be executed at a precise moment, and for each consecutive hit a bar at the bottom is filled up. This is used to execute Superstyles, a brutal attack from up close.",

With his pattern of killing his victims within four days time is running out to save him. This is where the lives of four characters become entangled as they all search to stop the Origami Killer: Ethan Mars, a former architect overcome with depression and guilt over an accident leading to one of his son's death; Norman Jayden, an FBI profiler investigating the Origami case using an experimental device known as ARI (Added Reality Interface); Madison Paige, a nightmare filled journalist who unexpectedly finds her way into the investigation; and Scott Shelby, a private eye hired by families of victims of the serial killer to find things the authorities may have missed.Heavy Rain is an interactive drama title combining adventure and action elements. The story revolves around the lives of four characters as they try to stop the Origami Killer from taking the life of another victim. The game has a heavy emphasis on user choices, with different decisions you make completely changing the way the story unfolds and which will lead to one of the many possible endings the game offers. There is no game-over screen if one of or all of the main characters die, there will just be a different ending given. Similar to Quantic Dream's previous title Indigo Prophecy/Fahrenheit, the game is moved along primarily by the use of QTEs (Quick Time Events). Movement of your character is done by holding the R2 button and choosing a direction with the left analog stick. Holding the L2 button brings up your characters thoughts and pressing the button to go along with each thought will lead him/her to say or do something.Budget re-release of Heavy Rain includes game patch to support PlayStation Move controller (the patch can also be downloaded as standalone for free). That includes budget releases such as Platinum (in Europe), Greatest Hits (in America), or PlayStation 3 the Best (in Asia).",

Who can grab the suit, put Weaselby in his place, and seal up the other world, all before Tea Time?  Why, Henry Hatsworth, of course!Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure is a hybrid of two styles of game - the top screen has an action-platformer starring Hatsworth, who must defeat enemies with his sword.  When he does, they fall down into the Puzzle Realm on the Touch Screen, which plays like Tetris Attack.  Players must match the block enemies up with other colored blocks to finally destroy them, before they rise up back to the top screen to harass Hatsworth once again.Henry also has access to a super meter - by clearing blocks in the Puzzle Realm, he fills it up.  If he fills it up enough, it's Tea Time!  This means that Hatsworth can transform into superpowered steampunk robot that shoots lasers and missiles and is completely invulnerable, which is handy when the player is in a jam.",

The game is viewed from a top-down perspective, and Hero may be moved in any direction. Monsters on each screen may be shot and killed, but will respawn if Hero leaves the screen and enters again.Hero contains five levels, each consisting of multiple rooms connected in a maze-like fashion, with most rooms containing enemies, and some containing barriers or doors that cannot be passed. Doors can be opened by defeating the boss enemy that serves as their key. Each level has a 'generator' which unlocks all barriers. Hero starts each level with five lives, and upon reaching a new level, it becomes possible to jump directly to it from the title screen. After completing all five levels, Hero gains access to Cruiser Tetron's hideout, for the final confrontation.Beating the game unlocks bonus features, including an extra, difficult level.",

Each player controls a jet airplane which zooms across the screen and may turn into a ground based soldier. These ground soldiers can hurt enemy units, but can not affect bases. To take over bases scattered across the map (and ultimately, the enemy base), players must purchase new units and transport them to certain positions. In this way, the player acts more like a transport and management for different types of units rather than a combat character themselves. If the plane is ever destroyed, it restarts at the player's base location. As previously mentioned, a level is complete when either side's base is lost to the opposing forces.",

But, as he spends the night there, the secrets and past of the hotel's guests reveal themselves.  What is so special about Room 215?  What do these people have to hide?  It's up to you to take control and find out.Hotel Dusk: Room 215 is an adventure game from the creators of Another Code.  The player takes on the role of Kyle Hyde as he searches through Hotel Dusk.  You hold the DS in the same manner as you would a book to play.  The game takes place in two different perspectives: the touch screen is used to navigate top-down through the hotel, while the top screen displays a first person view of your surroundings.  You can strike up a conversation with the guests, and when you do, Kyle, along with any questions  you have, appear on the touch screen.  The person you're questioning appears on the top screen.  When interrogating people, you can stop them at points in conversation and press them for information.  However, if you're not careful, you'll arouse suspicion and may even get kicked out of the hotel.The game also features different kinds of puzzles, ranging from physically using your inventory to manipulate objects (such as jiggling a wire in a lock to pick it), or completing logic puzzles, like assembling a jigsaw.  Hotel Dusk also features a unique art style: the characters are drawn in an animated sketchbook-type fashion.  Some scenes feature a partially watercolored look, but most of the time the characters themselves appear in black and white.",

Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.If the player wants to go to the next event or round, they will have to qualify by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum targets.",

            "Description": "Hyrule Warriors is a hack and slash action game set in The Legend of Zelda universe with gameplay very similar to Tecmo Koei Games' Dynasty Warriors series where characters fight in battles against hundreds of enemies at once. The game is set in the Zelda world of Hyrule and you start with Link as a Hylian soldier trainee. The world's evil presence Ganondorf was once defeated and his soul was split into four fragments that were hidden in different places. Even though Ganondorf was defeated he managed to influence the sorceress Cia to open portals in time where monsters are able to pass through. At the start of the game Hyrule castle is under attack and rookie Link manages to impress on the battlefield. In the confusion Zelda disappears and Hyrule castle is captured. Link investigates with Zelda's trustee Impa and is given the trademark green outfit, offered to the hero who can restore the balance of the Triforce.In the main Legend mode Link travels through different environments linked together on a world map, fighting to meet the victory conditions. Other characters are gradually unlocked as well, so it possible to play as Impa, Sheik, Zeda, Lana, Darunia or Fi for instance. Fighting is based on fast combos, often attacking multiple enemies at once, while incoming attacks can be avoided through dodge rolls. It is possible to lock the camera onto a single enemy to keep it in view and then cycle between different ones. Defeating enemies adds to a global experience level used to level up. It also fills up a yellow attack gauge and when full a powerful attack can be unleashed, often damaging over 50 enemies at once. Picked up magic jars fill up a green magic gauge. When full focus spirit can be activated. It temporarily increases the attack power and speed, reduces knock back damage and provides bonuses when killing many enemies at once. By then consuming the magic gauge entirely a focus spirit attack is activated to knock down opponents and expose weak points.Many large opponents have weak points. Once exposed a weak points gauge meter appears above an enemy and when it has filled up by attacking another powerful move can be performed. Items to collect during battles includes rupees, bonuses for magic, health and items, weapon fragments, vases to destroy for health, materials and temporary item power-ups from enemies. Multiple items can be collected and equipped, with the ability to cycle between them quickly. These are often found in treasure chests. One of the important items is the bomb used to deal damage and clear obstacles. The maps are generally very large with multiple areas to control. The main character almost never fights alone and has to keep track of different goals and objectives to move around quickly. These include capturing areas, defeating bosses and protecting certain characters. When the goals are ignored it is possible the defeat conditions are reached and the level is lost, even without dying. Goals can be tracked in the options menu and they can also through the mini-map in the top right corner. Green arrows appear in the level to help navigation and the fairy Proxi provides tips and suggestions.Levels often contain multiple keeps that keep spawning endless reinforcements when under enemy control. By defeating enemies in such an area a keep meter can be reduced, causing a keep boss to appear. When defeated the keep is controlled, but it can be recaptured. Other levels have outposts with a similar mechanic. By defeating an outpost captain soldiers spawning for your side can be activated. Armies have a morale system, shown through colour, which can be improved when fighting alongside them. A specific event is the appearance of a gold Skulltula. There are one hundred in the game and they sometimes appear on the map in sections marked with a spider web before fleeing again. When defeated they provide a piece of an illustration. There are five full illustrations in total and these provide rewards such as perks and potions. After completing an area rupees are provided for the clear bonus, clear time and additional bonuses such as completed objectives.Before starting a level a warrior can be chosen along with weapons of different types, and outfits. Rupees can be spent at the bazar. At the badge market for instance rupees and material can be used to craft attack, defense or assist badges with various enchantments. The training dojo is used to trade rupees for leveling characters quickly, and the apothecary provides temporary mixtures and restorative potions for empty bottles. Many skills and badges are tied to the character they are crafted with and these can be transferred afterwards at the smithy.Next to the main Legend mode there is an Adventure mode with a map similar to the 8-bit Zelda games. By completing objectives new parts of the grid can be unlocked and there are segments where classic Zelda items are used. The third mode is the Free mode where players can experiment with all available characters freely. The final game mode is the Challenge mode where specific challenges need to be completed. New challenges are provided through updated at a regular basis. Many characters, enemies and environments are inspired by earlier Zelda games.The game supports local cooperative multiplayer, either playing split-screen or with one player using the TV and the other one with an own screen on the GamePad. Off-TV play is also supported for single-player games. Certain achievements can be shared in the Miiverse.",

A man who calls himself Mr. Smith is interested in a certain ancient statue. When the unsuspecting Indy hands it over to the client, he finds out that Mr. Smith is in fact a colonel in the Nazi army! Why was he so interested in that statue? A young woman who had once worked together with Indy, the pretty red-haired (and a bit troublesome) Sophia, tells him the whole thing must have a connection with the legendary lost continent Atlantis. Gathering clues from all over the world, Indy and Sophia embark on a grand journey across the globe.Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is a puzzle-solving adventure game conceived in the spirit of Indiana Jones movies; however, it is not based on a specific movie, introducing a new, independent story. The game utilizes LucasArts' SCUMM system, with action verbs the player chooses from a menu; objects that can be interacted with are highlighted. The game contains many puzzles of various kinds (mostly inventory-based) and dialogues with multiple choices. There are also a few simple hand-to-hand fights against the Nazis, some of which can be avoided.The middle part of the game can be played in three \"modes\": co-operation (Indy and Sophia), adventure (Indy alone), and action (Indy alone, with less puzzles and more action). In each mode there are different locations to visit, different puzzles to solve, and different characters to meet. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to all the conversations.",

However, he starts to notice an unusual change in his body, a supernatural power over electricity which he soon learns to control. By then, a sickness has lead the government to quarantine the entire city, enabling street gangs to overwhelm the police and establish a violent rule over the population and the increasingly scarce supplies. Trapped in a desolate city of people who hold him responsible for the explosion, wanted by the police and hunted by the Reapers who try to stay in control of the streets, Cole must decide whose side he's on. Will he use his new-found powers to assure his own survival and take revenge on the people that condemn him, or will he use them to gain their respect by aiming for the greater good? Will he become a famous superhero, or an infamous super villain?inFAMOUS is an action game taking place in a free city environment. It takes a different approach to comic book style games by not giving players control over a powerful superhero, but having them fill the role of a regular guy who is just starting to discover his supernatural abilities. Through their actions, they are able to decide whether Cole will become a hero that the inhabitants of the city admire and look up to, or a selfish man who fights for his survival and that of his friends, even if it means the death of others. When encountering Cole in the streets, citizens react according to his reputation.The game can only be played in a single-player story mode, where Empire City is fully explorable. A karma meter shows how many good and bad deeds have been done. Experience points gained in combat and upon completing tasks can be spent on improving Cole's control over his electric powers, where some improvements are only available with a certain amount or positive or negative karma. Relying on electricity for health and powers, Cole needs to recharge himself wherever he can find an electric current, which is made more difficult by the occasional power outages happening in different areas of the city.",

Master Li explains that the leader was a member of the Lotus Assassins, a special force serving the Emperor of the Jade Empire, who also happens to be his brother. The student is revealed to be the last in the line of Spirit Monks, whose abode was destroyed several years ago by the Emperor's army. The student ventures into a nearby cave to retrieve a part of an ancient amulet; meanwhile, the assailants burn down the town and abduct Master Li. The student and a few companions decide to go all the way to the Imperial Capital and explore the Jade Empire in order to rescue the master, find the truth about the past, and discover the dark secrets of the Empire's rulers.Jade Empire is a role-playing game set in a fantasy world which has strong similarities to China of the Qing dynasty (within some steampunk elements), incorporating not only classical elements of Chinese culture, but also supernatural beings and forces. Similar to other BioWare RPGs (such as Knights of the Old Republic) in general concept and features, the game has overall simpler gameplay and a somewhat smaller world.The combat in the game is action-based, relying on various martial art techniques and moves performed by the protagonist. The player has direct control only over the main character, although other characters join the party; one of them can be selected to help the protagonist in battles, either for purely supportive purposes or as an additional combatant. The player character has three attributes: Body, Mind, and Spirit, which control the secondary parameters of Health, Focus, and Chi, as well as the conversation skills Charm, Intuition, and Intimidation. Focus energy is needed to fight with weapons (swords and staves), while Chi is used to heal the protagonist or perform supernatural attacks comparable to magic spells. Experience points are obtained from completing quests and vanquishing enemies, and allocated by the player to increase the protagonist's aforementioned attributes.Quest and conversation system bears more similarities to previous BioWare RPGs than combat and character customization. There are many side quests in the game, some of which can be solved through dialogue, applying the main character's conversation skills. Many quests, including plot-related ones, can be solved in different ways. The protagonist may embrace either of the two major philosophies of the Jade Empire, Way of the Open Palm or Way of the Closed Fist, roughly corresponding to \"good\" and \"evil\" ideologies, respectively. Pursuing one of these ideologies rather than hesitating between the two may award the player character with various bonuses. The protagonist can also romance some of the companions, including same-sex relationships.",

The graphics are deliberately crude and all persons are presented like figures from a board game.From a gameplay perspective, this is an adventure game: the player solves puzzles by using items with other items (or simply by finding the correct item to activate). There are also various mandatory and optional mini games like playing mini golf, participating in a boat race, Galaga or a first-person shooter sequence with a wedding theme. However, the main draw of the game is its non-sequential humour. When exploring the levels, there are many references to discover and many optional items to activate which usually has a humorous consequence.",

Stop the evil space bug, Mizar, from his goal of galactic conquest with his seemingly-infinite army of Drones.  They'll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and rescuing his subjects, the Tribals.Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic creepy bugs explode into dribbly mucousy bits.  The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful weapons, from the Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can charge up for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every shot, sending explosive doom in the direction of your target.  There's also the Fish Food, which, as the name implies, is used to feed fish.Each member of the team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, Vela can swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces.  These abilities are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn't reach.  The team also get the help of Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a floating gun with infinite ammo when he joins your team.The game also includes three different multiplayer modes: Battle - featuring most options of an average First Person Shooter but with a third-person perspective, Target Shoot - a shooting gallery with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as old-school top down racing games.",

The rooms are filled with strange creatures, and Willy can be killed by touching any of them, by falling from great heights or by hazardous environments.

            "Description": "In Journey the player controls a robed character through a vast desert with large areas that can be freely explored in any direction. No instructions are given, but a large mountain is shown in the far distance and the character moves towards it. The game does not have a HUD and provides no clear directions. There also are no hazards or obstacles that lead to death. The goal is to guide the character through a journey. The character can be moved around and is able to whistle, as a short burst or more powerful depending on how long the button is pressed. Whistling makes a symbol appear and it is used to activate glyphs in the environment. After a while the player also learns to fly by activating floating pieces of cloth in the environment. These lift the character into the air. It is then possible to float for a short time or glide down through the sand. Once \"charged\", it is possible to give a few short busts while in the air. Through the journey the flying abilities improve. When moving towards a platform, the character jumps on it automatically when it is low enough. The main challenge in the game is to find a way to progress, by activating bridges or finding a route.Players can enable an online function to activate a cooperative mode. Other games worldwide are scanned and when another player is in the same area, the characters appear in each other's games and can travel together. No direct communication is possible, but through movement and whistling indirect interaction is possible. Playing together with an anonymous player provides an additional advantage. When the characters are near each other, they charge the other character to enable a single flying charge. This is done automatically. No challenges need to be overcome through cooperation however; it is purely aesthetic similar to the communication between deer in The Endless Forest rather than the cooperative gameplay of Between for instance. Players can also leave the other behind at any time. Next to the main goal to journey, it is possible to locate and activate hidden glyphs. These have no further effect on the gameplay. When the entire game is finished, the user names of the companions met along the way are shown.",

He will travel from the deep caverns of the Underworld to Medusa's palace in the sky on his journey, and deadly monsters will attack him every step of the way. But he has the power of the Gods on his side! A powerful bow and arrows, Water of Life, and Angel Feathers will assist Pit on his quest to destroy Medusa and save the princess!Kid Icarus is a platform game where the player goes through several vertically outlaid levels, shooting enemies with his bow on the way and collecting hearts they leave behind. Pit's bow can shoot both forward and upwards. As Pit continues upwards, more and more of the level ends up beyond the bottom of the screen and if Pit falls down out of the screen, he dies. The levels contain doors which lead to chambers of various types - some chambers are filled with enemies, some are treasuries which allow Pit to obtain a power-up, some are stores where Pit can buy stuff, some will replenish his health, in some Pit will be able to take a test in hopes of getting a powerful weapon, and finally some chambers give Pit a chance of receiving a strength upgrade, therefore increasing the amount of damage his attacks deal. Pit earns experience as he defeats enemies, and he gains levels from this experience. The more levels Pit has, the more maximum health he has. Hearts taken from enemies are used in shops to buy various items and power-ups. Items include a protective shield which harms enemies, a more powerful bow, a mallet which allows you to smash the poor Palutena's warriors turned to stone who will later help you to fight a boss, a torch to see yourself in dark areas and others.

They need to work together in a platform environment to explore the temple, defeat hordes of enemies from the Egyptian underworld, solve puzzles, and avoid traps, using a high-angle perspective like the previous game. When playing together, the level lay-outs change to support cooperative actions.Weapons include machine-gun pistols, a magic staff, a rocket launcher, and a high-powered rifle. The main story offers nine tombs to explore, each introducing a new mechanic such as avoiding spikes, lighting torches to power gates or using beams of the staff to destroy orbs. There are also five challenge tombs with a higher difficulty and wave-based battle sequences, accessed from a main world hub. Puzzle elements including pushing orbs to destroy switches and Lara can also rappel down walls using a grappling hook. By completing levels gems are earned. These can be spent on one of two treasure chests to receive items that mainly affect combat and enhance weapons, but there there are also items that transfer enemy damage to your health. In co-op stat boosts and new weapons are shared between members of the group.",

            "Description": "LittleBigPlanet is a puzzle platformer where the player controls sackboys. It takes the characters on an adventure through levels with different themes and settings, trying to reach the end of each level alive. The platforming is based entirely on physics where the sackboys can push or pull items, or generally manipulate them with their movement or weight. In addition to running, jumping, pushing and pulling, it is also necessary to master grabbing dangling objects and swinging from them to get over some obstacles and traps.The game can be played by up to four players simultaneously with some puzzles requiring more than one player to be solved. Levels consists of three planes: foreground, middle, and background, which can be traversed.Next to the main game with about 50 levels, a large portion is devoted to creating user generated content. Players can design their own levels and devise custom rules. The objects used to build up the levels are largely based on the characteristics of real world materials emulated by the physics engine.During the course of a level, stickers can be picked up for (mostly) decorative purposes or new items used to dress up the sackboys or for inclusion in the player's own levels. User created content can be shared via the PlayStation Network.",

If he likes it, he will move in shortly and bring his dog along with him. That's where the real \"game\" starts and that's what it will be like every time you'll load the game from then. You see the house and the little person living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to time he will write you a letter to let you know what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it more game-like, you can \"talk\" to him in form of typing commands like \"feed dog\". You can also play cards with him and send him food or a present. There is no aim in this game other than to interact with your LCP.",

The LocoRoco love to sing, but now the Moja have learned a song of their own - one so dreadful that it is able to suck out the life of all living things!  The player must control the planet once more to not only protect the LocoRoco, but protect the entire planet itself!LocoRoco 2 is a sequel to the PSP game, LocoRoco.  As with the original game, the player controls the planet, and tilts it by using the L and R Buttons on the PSP.  By pressing both L and R simultaneously, the planet gives a shake and makes the LocoRoco jump.  Tapping the Circle button scares the LocoRoco, making them split apart into smaller ones and allowing them to squeeze through gaps.  Holding Circle merges them back into one large LocoRoco again.As players explore the LocoRoco's world, they will encounter places poisoned by the Moja's awful singing.  By hitting the black blobby areas with the LocoRoco, the poison will break off and restore the area to normal.  Players can destroy Mojas themselves in the same way.  As the LocoRoco explore the levels, they will discover musical notes - collecting enough of these will give the player bonus help in exploring the levels.  Occasionally, players will encounter brief mini-games where they must tap the beat to the LocoRoco's songs to earn even more musical notes.New to LocoRoco 2 is Loco Rider - this mini-game can be played wirelessly with up to four players in ad-hoc mode.  The aim is to push the opponents into the thorns using your LocoRoco to shrink theirs before they do the same to you!",

            "Description": "The Age of the Great Guilds has arrived. Communities and states comprised of people united by a common trade were created. The Guild of Weavers has achieved such mastery in their trade that they discovered the secret of weaving the very fabric of reality. They were treated with suspicion by other guilds, who eventually accused them of practicing witchcraft and banned them to a secluded island, which they called Loom.Bobbin Threadbare is a young man from the Guild of Weavers. He is outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times, though he does not know why. On his seventeenth birthday he is summoned by the Elders of the guild, who intend to decide his fate. However, shortly thereafter all the inhabitants of the village except Bobbin are turned into swans. Bobbin finds out that he is the child of the Great Loom, found by Lady Cygna, who tried to use the loom's powers to save the guild. Bobbin's stepmother Dame Hetchel teaches him the art of weaving magical drafts, and Bobbin embarks on a journey to find the lost flock, and the answers to his questions.Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called \"drafts\" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called \"distaff\". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts. Each draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be \"reversed\", i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.The game features three difficulty levels, differentiating them by changing the way the interface works. The easiest level displays names of the notes as well as marking the correspondent areas on the distaff; Standard level features the distaff with the marks at the bottom of the screen, but no written notes; whereas Expert does not display the marks at all, requiring the player to memorize and play the drafts by ear.The CD DOS version of the game has enhanced 256-color graphics, audio tracks, and full voice acting. However, it also removes a few close-up scenes and conversations. The FM Towns version preserves these scenes and includes similar graphical and musical enhancements, but has no voice acting.",

However, during his quest he is captured by Boroth Wolfheart and imprisoned. His son Morkin must rescue him and find a way to defeat the forces of evil.Gameplay-wise, the game is similar to the previous Lords of Midnight games. The player can either take control of a single hero, or send troops to fight the armies of the opponent, making the game similar to both role-playing and strategy games. Characters can be given tasks, which they execute without the need of the player's further input. Unlike in the preceding games, the movement of the troops occurs in real time.

The game features all the modes of the previous version, and also adds several new features.Returning game modes include play now, franchise, mini-camp and practice. Superstar Challenge mode also returns (with all-new situations from the 2008 season), but offers an additional twist: in addition to playing the \"Hero\", players can also play the \"Spoiler\" and prevent the historical moments from happening. A play designer has been added that allows players to create plays and formations for use in the game's playbooks. Created plays can be uploaded to the PS3 version.On the field, a mini-game for fumble recovery has been added, similar to the one seen in other versions: when during a fumble, both teams are in range of the ball, who gains possession is decided by a quick-time event, requiring both mashing of buttons and hitting the correct buttons in sequence. Another addition is a player momentum system: depending on their performance during a game, individual players have hot or cold streaks, influencing their further performance. The game also features newly-recorded commentary by Tom Hammond and Cris Collinsworth.",

Planets are protected against your shots, until all their moons are destroyed; at this point, they go mad (visible as a bright orange glow) and attempt to ram you to death.The ship is free to move throughout the screen, using separate controls for movement and rotation. If you wipe out all the planets while they're still growing in size (before they acquire their moons), you're awarded the \"perfect round\" bonus, which varies from level to level.

In an effort to stop him, Dr. Fred sends three friends, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne back in time to yesterday, in order for them to turn off the Sludge-o-matic and stop the sludge from spilling into the river, thus preventing the whole incident. Naturally, the cheap doctor uses a fake diamond over a real one in his time machine, which blows up sending Hoagie 200 years into the past and Laverne 200 years into the future. Now the player must bring back Hoagie and Laverne, with the help of the time machine's ability to move objects between time periods, and then stop evil Purple from taking over the world.Day of the Tentacle is a point-and-click adventure game and a sequel to Maniac Mansion. The player controls Bernard, and later also Hoagie and Laverne, being able to switch between them at any time. By using the commands at the bottom of the screen, the character can pick up items, use them on other things, talk to people and more. Any of the three friends can also send his items across time to another friend. The game takes place in the same area, but in three different eras, and thus affecting history takes a vital part in some puzzles. For instance, Hoagie can hide an item in the 18th century, and Laverne discovers it in the 23rd century - but by then, the item may have been affected by time and changed its properties. The CD version of the game contains voice-overs for all the dialogues.",

Bowser hasn't been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn't allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become members, so they've come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64. Mario Golf 64 features an all-star line up of 10 golfers from Nintendo's cast of video game celebrities, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf 64 is a special \"Time Attack Mode,\" where players must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible. Mario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you'll have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional \"Club Handicap Mode\" ensures that you stay close to the competition, so Luigi won't get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are cartoons, the physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.",

            "Description": "Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups. ",

            "Description": "Mario Kart DS is the continuation of the long running racing game series that began on the Super Nintendo. It features 16 new tracks as well as 16 tracks from the previous 4 games, with each set split up into the Nitro and Retro Grand Prix respectively. Eight racers are initially available, each with two go-karts to choose from. A number of characters and additional karts are also available to unlock. New items have been added to the arsenal, including a Blooper squid that squirts ink onto the screens of other players and a Bullet Bill power up that transforms the player into a giant, fast-travelling bullet on autopilot.One of the features of this version is its support for online Internet play through Nintendo's WiFi service. MKDS owners can challenge up to 3 other people in Grand Prix mode on 20 of the 32 tracks. Players can also match up with friends by trading \"Friend Codes\" that are generated based on the DS that is used and the copy of the game owned. Custom emblems to use on karts are supported through the game's paint program.Battle mode is also present with 8-player support and 6 tracks. This time, there are two modes to choose from: \"Balloon Battle\" and \"Shine Runners.\" Balloon Battle is similar to the previous versions of this mode, with the exception that every player starts with only one balloon, and 5 in reserve. Players can have 2 additional balloons by either holding the Select button while standing still to inflate them, or by blowing into the DS's microphone. \"Shine Runners\" tasks players to collect \"Shines,\" with the winner being the one that has the most.New to the series is \"Mission Mode,\" which consists of a series of single player objective-based missions. Each mission takes place on a section of a race track and tasks the player to accomplish goals not normally seen in the other game modes. Such tasks include picking up coins on the track, using items to take out enemies, and racing through numbered gates. Missions are split up into 6 sets of 8, with a 9th mission for each where players must battle against a boss character. Local wireless multiplayer is supported for up to 8 people in Grand Prix, VS, and Battle Modes. Time trial \"ghost\" data can be shared as well, and DS owners who don't have the game can use the Download &amp; Play option to join in Grand Prix mode. However, non Mario Kart owners are limited to selecting Shy Guy as their character.",

Players can now also play with motorbikes, which can do wheelies but are lighter and can't super boost, in contrast with karts. There's 6 varieties of each for each character class to choose from, and 4 new characters have been added as well as being able to drive with your Mii. Finally, there's 16 new tracks as well as 16 returning from previous games.Gameplay has also been modified. Drifting has been tweaked so that it's easier to use and players only get a turbo boost based on how well they perform the drift. It can be set to Manual, where players press a button to drift, or Automatic, where it's automatically triggered on curves but provides no turbo boost. Stunts can also be performed in the air to gain turbo boosts. Races have also been bolstered to support up to 12 players now.There's 4 modes of play to choose from: Grand Prix, where you race through series of tracks in the 50cc (karts only), 100cc (bikes only) and 150cc (karts and bikes) cups; Time Trial, where you take on ghost replays and try to finish in the least time; Versus, where you race against opponents on a single track; and Battle, where you can compete against your foes in either hitting them with weapons or collecting coins.Multiplayer is also supported, allowing up to 4 players in hotseat and 12 online on Nintendo Wi-Fi, where you can take on strangers and friends (with Friend Codes) in any game mode, play in competitions, beat other's ghost replays or check online rankings. The game can be played using a Wii Wheel (included), Wii Remote, Nunchuck, Classic Controller, or Gamecube Controller.",

However, the mini-games have been completely revamped to take advantage of the Wii remote. For example, some have players point the remote at the screen to shoot guns or other such things. Other mini-games use the motion sensor to shake soda cans, cut logs in half, hammer nails in place, paint, fly planes, drive cars, etc. There are still others that are played more traditionally by holding the Wii remote on its side and using the control pad to move and the buttons to perform actions, such as jumping and/or punching.Players can choose between five different modes: Party Tent, Star Battle, Mini-games, Extras Zone, or Fun Bazaar. In Party Tent mode, players play on boards with a choice between battle royales, teams, or duels. In a Battle Royale, people compete for stars: the winner is determined by number of stars and/or coins after a certain amount of turns. In Team Battle, players split off into teams. And in a duel, two players compete against each other.Star Battle is basically a duel on each board against different characters (for one player). The player wins each board by completing a certain task. For instance, the player must collect so many stars on some boards. For other boards, he or she has to get to the star with a certain amount of coins.",

The player's goal is to bring the culture of their choice to world domination in the course of 500 years - through the High Middle Ages through the Late Middle Ages until the Renaissance, complete with the exploration of America.Like Rome: Total War, players manage their cities and move their units around on a world map in a turn-based mode to conquer new cities or defeat enemies threatening their land. Players always need to watch after their people, in order to avoid them getting angry with their rulers and starting a revolution. Players also need to fulfill goals set by their religious leader, such as going on a crusade for the Pope.When a battle starts and the player chooses not to have the AI calculate the outcome, the game switches to a full 3D battlefield where he must command his units as squads in real-time on the battlefield. There players need to use tactics like sending the cavalry into the nearby woods for a surprise attack at the enemies' flanks and making use of the overall terrain, like high ground, which are good for bowmen to overcome the enemy.

            "Description": "First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.\n \nOnce you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level.If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.The main thing as always in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.",

The game's original realistic graphics have been turned into a more cartoon style. The mercury now has a black line around the outside of it.The main change in the game is the ability to change the mercury into 3 more states. Besides normal state now you can turn the mercury into the \"Fast\" or \"Slow\" using a heater and a cooler, and using a solidifier you can make it unto \"Solid\" state, a round, non-breakable ball. The mercury can still be split using a splitter, needed to solve certain puzzles.Unlike the original Mercury, the game is split into themed \"Labs\"  rather than “Worlds”. There are 10 Labs, with 16 initial stages: Astro, Bio, Chemical, Electro, Geo, Atom, Aero, Hydro, Micro, V.R. (Virtual Reality). The PS2 version adds two more: Chrono and Cryo, as well as twin analog control, support for the rumble feature, improved graphics and all the levels from the original Archer Maclean's Mercury. There are 168 stages in the PSP version and over 200 in the PS2 game. Unlike the previous game, there is no strict order to play the levels. Once a Lab has been unlocked, you can play all the stages included right away.Attributes show how well you do in the games. The best performance is awarded with a golden cork, based on four conditions: a high score (a 1 sticker), all bonus items found (a star sticker), 100% mercury (a corked test-tube), and complete the level within the time limit. While playing, your progress is measured in faces that replace the time clock. The time limit cannot cause the game to end anymore, instead it just turns into a sad face and players can still complete the level. The mercury limits have also been removed, but 100% mercury is still needed to access some of the later stages.The top right corner shows a color chart, to help with mixing colors in the game. This can also be done in the paintshop. This release adds multi-paintshops, triangle base pyramid shaped constructions with 3 different coloured gates on either side.In addition to the main game, there are now five party games, which are unlocked by collecting the bonus stars in the main game:Metrix: puzzle games where coloured blocks need to be fit inside a pre-defined grid.Paint: move the mercury to paint the tray as much as possible against your opponent.Race: guide mercury around speedy track with boost pads and avoid falling off.Rodeo: tilt the playing area to keep the mercury on the field, while a fan tries to knock you off.\nShove: aim the mercury for the center spot of the target, just like curling.All the party games can be played in multiplayer over Wi-Fi on the PSP. The tutorial is now separate from the main game, and there is an additional Playground mode where you can test the different items in the game.",

Discovery, investigating the development of a new Metal Gear-type weapon. A confrontation with a Russian military group as well as an old acquaintance from Snake's past adventure leads to a massive detonation, after which Snake is presumed dead.Fast-forward to the year 2009: the player takes control of Raiden, a rookie agent operating under the order of the Colonel, apparently member of a reformed Foxhound unit. His initial assignment is to infiltrate the offshore clean-up facility Big Shell and rescue the President of the United States of America, who was kidnapped by members of a terrorist organization known as Sons of Liberty. However, the matters become increasingly complicated as almost everyone Raiden communicates with appears to have a hidden agenda, and it is hard to tell a friend from foe...Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is the sequel to the espionage action game  Metal Gear Solid. Much of the gameplay remains the same, as the game's protagonist has to sneak past guards, outsmart them using various gadgets, and defeat the tricky boss enemies. There are a host of weapons to be picked up through out the game, some old, such as the FAMAS and Socom, and some new, such as the AK-47. Martial arts combos can be used to disable guards. It is possible to crawl through small spaces, peek around corners, and perform acrobatic leaps to get away. The protagonist can also hang from railings, effectively hiding from guard, or stick his gun in a guard's back, surprising him. The cardboard box is also back, and can once again be used for hiding. Gadgets such as sneak suit, mine detector, thermal goggles and others can be found along the way.. The radar from the original game is still there and alerts the player to guards' positions and also shows their field of view. If an alarm is sounded the radar is disabled while the hero has to escape. In some situations it is necessary to enable the radar before it becomes possible to use it.Like its predecessor, the game is heavy on codec conversations and cutscenes. All the cutscenes in the game use the in-game 3D engine; the characters' movements are motion captured animations. ",

Now, with Sokolov in their hands, they're up to developing a powerful new weapon, and upon realizing the urgency of the situation, CIA formed a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit's modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking mission.August 24, 1964, a lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake. It's a one-man war now, and the future of the world may now rest entirely on his shoulders.Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is the prequel to the entire Metal Gear series. Most of the series' defining gameplay elements have been carried over. As before, Snake must use stealth and wits rather than brute force to infiltrate enemy zones and eliminate his major adversaries. Action set-pieces and boss battles that require the player to figure out the enemy's weakpoints and employ unique tactics to defeat him are also present.Several notable gameplay features have been added. Unlike the previous games, much of the action in this installment takes place in a large outdoor environment, the (geographically inaccurate) jungle. Snake is able to use camouflage: climb trees, hide in tall grass, or wear clothes that make him less noticeable. Snake can also grow tired and hungry; collecting rations or even hunting wild animals for food is necessary. He can sustain injuries (for example, breaking an arm), which must be treated in a specific way, as opposed to the single health bar of the predecessors.",

            "Description": "Metal Gear Solid 4 is the fourth major game in the Metal Gear Solid series developed by Hideo Kojima. It ties up all of the loose plot points of the previous games while bringing back a number of characters from the earlier games in the series such as Colonel Campbell, Naomi Hunter, Otacon, Meryl Silverburgh, Mei Ling and many more. The game's main antagonist is Liquid Ocelot. Most of the story and the relationship is explained through cut-scenes with a considerable length. Due to the series extensive history, knowledge of the prior games is recommended to fully understand the story.As the story begins Solid Snake, now looking like an old man due to accelerated aging, is being deployed in the Middle East on a mission to stop Liquid Ocelot. The game is set in 2014, five years after the Big Shell Incident of Metal Gear Solid 2. Liquid aims to take control of the Sons of the Patriots, the nanomachine system used to enhance the capabilities of the mercenaries of different factions. By this he plans to assemble an army. The game is divided into five acts followed by an epilogue and a briefing. The various missions bring Old Snake to more than one location, including the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe and a few more that can surprise the players familiar with the franchise.In this game all of the actions of the previous game have been included along with some new ones such as the ability to roll on your back and fire and the ability to hide in bins scattered around the environment. Similar to the Subsistence re-release of MGS3, the player has full control of the camera rotation on one analogue stick while walking with the other. Shooting is now enhanced to support a new shoulder camera not seen in the franchise before, much similar to that of Resident Evil 4 which will help you to easily counter-attack the enemy without having to fire randomly or switching to 1st-person perspective. The Close Quarters Combat system has been redesigned and players are now able to interrogate guards for information or supplies. The earlier camouflage system has been replaced with Octocamo that allows Snake to blend into the environment. The stamina meter from Snake Eater has been replaced by a stress meter. Based on the fighting and the climate conditions it can offer additional accuracy and reduces sustained damage. The other meter, Psyche, reduces accuracy and can be replenished by reading an adult magazine, eating or drinking.Snake has access to the largest arsenal of weapons ever made available in a Metal Gear game, with a large array of pistols, rifles and explosives, along with the ability to mod the weapons adding scopes, suppressors, lights and other equipment to create custom weapons.Other gadgets in the game including the Solid Eye, which is an electronic eye patch that can be used as binoculars, night vision goggles or just a device for displaying information about enemies and items scattered around the levels. There is also the Metal Gear Mk. II, which is a small robot that can be used to scout levels and electrocute enemies knocking them out for a period of time.The game also features a complex multiplayer mode, simply entitled Metal Gear Online. Aside from the usual suspects of multiplayer shooter modes, such as \"deathmatch\" and \"capture the flag\", there are some original modes that are based on the stealth aspects of the single player games. \"Sneaking Mission\" mostly plays out like a standard team deathmatch, with the exception that one player is assigned to control Snake, who is equipped with his radar and Octocamo. Snake's goal is to tranquilise his enemies in order to acquire their dog tags, without getting spotted. If there are enough players in the game, one player will also control Metal Gear Mk.II to assist Snake. \"Team Sneaking\" is basically \"Capture the flag\", in which the attacking team is equipped with stealth camouflage and non-lethal weapons. The defending team can only see the attacking team's shadows and weapons. ",

            "Description": "Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops is the first real Metal Gear game on the PSP, unlike the two preceding Metal Gear Ac!d games with turn-based strategy gameplay.It's been six years since the events in Snake Eater. Snake has been captured and imprisoned in an abandoned missile silo in Colombia, and with no support this time. At least, not at first. With the help of a fellow prisoner, Snake escapes and the game truly begins.Portable Ops is a classic Metal Gear game in almost every sense. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has played previous console entries in the series. Snake can peek around corners, sneak up behind guards... they even carried over CQC (Close Quarters Combat) from Snake Eater.What really sets Portable Ops apart (aside from being on the PSP) is the pacing, and a few changes to the gameplay mechanics. The game is played out in missions, which are specific to certain areas. Most of the areas are not that large, which sometimes means seeing \"Mission Complete\" in only a matter of minutes. The ability to play through the game in segments really lends itself to the handheld format. If you only have five minutes, choose a quick mission, knock it out, save and you are done. Being able to return to each area whenever you want to procure more supplies means that even once you finish your mission, you will be coming back.Gathering supplies is also essential due to the main new mechanic found in Portable Ops: recruiting. While Snake starts out on his own, he can enlist disgruntled guards, frustrated technicians, stubborn doctors and more. These soldiers can be used in your \"Sneaking Unit\" (the team you take into battle for each mission), or in one of the many support units, with certain soldiers having a more natural talent for certain areas. If you put someone who has medical bonuses in your Medical unit, they can produce rations, help your troops recover faster between missions and more. Technicians can create new items for your team, and Spies can steal ammo and give you intel on specific maps, which can open up new side missions or allow you to grab some heavy weaponry.Missions themselves range from recon to rescue to demolitions and beyond. You can only take four troops into a mission, and usually one of them has to be Snake. However, you don't have to always use Snake during the mission, he just has to be present. You can only control one character at a time, while the rest of the team hides safely inside boxes (usually right by the entry point). On the field, the soldier you use can make a big difference. Many times you can totally bypass a building's defenses just by playing as a guard. If you do not do anything to draw attention to yourself, you can oftentimes walk right past the enemy, plant some TNT, and walk away.Several soldiers even have special abilities that come in handy during a mission, such as being able to transfer extra items you pick up directly to your truck (each character is limited to four inventory slots), or drag unconscious enemies twice as fast.The game supports multiplayer for up to six player simultaneously, over WiFi Ad Hoc and Infrastructure, with game modes such as Team Death Match, Death Match and Capture Mission.",

There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they \"ignite\" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into \"orbit\" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different \"planets\" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.",

            "Description": "A long time ago a race of beings called the Luminoth settled the planet Aether. They built energy controllers to harness the \"light of Aether\" to prolong the life of their planet and its inhabitants. After many ages of peace and prosperity, a meteor collided with the planet; this collision opened a dimensional rift into another world, called Dark Aether. From this world came an evil race of beings known as the Ing, and for many ages a war was fought between the Ing of the dark world and the Luminoth of the light world. Over time the Ing began winning, turning the light world to dark. At about this time, a federation spacecraft happens to be chasing a Space Pirate vessel, which is destroyed by the Ing, through the area. Wondering about the fate of this craft, the Galactic Federation sends an urgent message to Samus Aran, asking her to find the crew and investigate the planet Aether.This is the sequel to Metroid Prime where players once again control bounty hunter Samus Aran as she arrives on Aether. The game is played from both a first-person view(walking, running, jumping) and third-person view (morph ball mode and cut scenes). The game uses a combination of action, adventure, and platform game elements; while searching the player is able to uncover the story by finding federation reports and Luminoth lore. There are variety of puzzles to solve to reach new locations, different landscapes that the player can jump and grapple across and attack plenty of enemies. As usual, players begin the game with limited capabilities but additional weapons and suit upgrades can be found, including some standards from the Metroid series such as the varia suit, morph ball bombs, and missiles along with a few new weapons, such as the dark suit, dark beam, and light beam.Metroid Prime 2: Echoes also features multiplayer modes for up to four players. In deathmatch, combatants need to hunt down each of the other players. This variation can be played either with a time limit or where the greatest number of frags wins. The second option is called bounty mode; in this variation each player starts with a number of bounty coins. When one player hits another player with a powerful attack, some of their coins will drop, which can be collected. Coins may also be found throughout the landscape, and the player with the most coins at the end wins.",

            "Description": "In the third and final outing of the Metroid Prime series, bounty hunter Samus Aran is contacted by the Galactic Federation to discover why a computer network, known as the \"Aurora Unit\", has started to malfunction. The Federation believes it is the work of their long-time nemesis, the Space Pirates, and dispatches Samus to investigate the situation. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a first-person action game that spans the course of several planets. Along the way, Samus meets with Federation members and other bounty hunters. Samus also runs into many old foes; one such foe, Dark Samus, corrupts her with Phazon energy that increases her powers via a PED (Phazon Enhancement Device). She can choose when to use this energy, but the Phazon will kill her if used for longer than a certain time period. Gameplay is set within several 3D worlds, following the traditional Metroid formula of finding various armor and weapon upgrades to use, exploring areas, fighting numerous bosses, and avoiding environmental dangers.  Although the game contains several action-heavy sequences involving firepower, the game's main focus stays with using new items at various locations to discover previously unexplored areas.The play control has been reworked to take advantage of the Wii's capabilities. For instance, players point the Wii Remote to aim Samus's arm cannon. The Nunchuk accessory is used for grappling objects; this grapple ability can be used to pull obstacles out of the way, grab an enemy's shield from its grip, or to swing across a gap. Samus can also use the Morph Ball to roll through small spaces or to escape enemies; Samus can even jump while in Morph Ball form without using bombs. Additionally, Samus can call her gunship to assist in battles, travel to other planets, or provide a mobile save point.Also new to the series are a collection of \"Achievements\", which can be unlocked by performing various tasks, such as killing a certain number of enemies, or scanning certain objects.  The Achievements can also be shared with friends via WiiConnect24, by posting photos, or unlocking other special bonuses.",

The titular island has been formed in the Azores group of islands, caused by volcanic activity.The player initially controls Captain John Stark, the commander of local militia known as Free Villages Police Force (FVPF), who attempt to protect their home from the invasion of armed troops under the command of General Masters. As Stark, the player has to recruit civilians and members of FVPF in order to join forces and prevent Masters from reaching the base located in the south-eastern part of the island.Midwinter is a hybrid game that combines elements of strategy and action. The player selects and controls the 32 recruits as they attempt to protect the island within a limited amount of time. Two hours of game time are assigned to each recruit; afterwards, the strategy battle moves to the next turn. During their turns, the recruits fight enemy forces in action-oriented combat reminiscent of a first-person shooter. Specific and detailed injuries add a tactical edge to these battles. Enemy units are mostly composed of armed snow buggies, as well as supply vehicles. Eliminating a large amount of them or killing the commander of the unit usually successfully completes the mission.Terrain plays an important role in the game, as many snow-covered mountain areas are impassable, and the player must plan ahead how to advance. The player can use snow buggies, ski, and cable cars to access the goal.When recruiting characters, the player has to pay attention to their personal relationships. For example, Stark can recruit his girlfriend, but another character will refuse to join because he is in love with her and jealous of the Captain. ",

            "Description": "Minecraft is a game which mixes elements of sandbox, survival horror and construction game. It is an evolved version of Minecraft Classic.As in Minecraft Classic the player is dropped in a randomly generated world made out of cubes. Unlike the classic version where the player can add and remove blocks at will, in this version all blocks the player wants to place must first be \"mined\" elsewhere. Some materials require special equipment to be mined. Stone requires a wooden pick axe to be mined; gold requires an iron pick axe and obsidian requires a diamond pick axe. The player can also create shovels and normal axes to mine sand, dirt and wood faster. Mining is no longer instant but requires the player to hit the block a couple times, tools reduce the time.Some blocks can not be found in nature but require crafting. Clay, for example, can be split into clay balls, which when baked turn into bricks which can be combined to form brick wall blocks. Baking happens in a stone oven, which requires a steady supply of coal and the oven itself needs to be crafted at a workbench, which needs to be constructed first.This time the player(s) are not alone. During the day pigs, chickens, cows and sheep roam the land. Some of them, when killed or struck, will drop valuable items such as leather required for protective clothing or pork chops which when baked can heal the player. But at night and in the dark randomly generated caverns monsters rule the land. There are various different monsters, including the zombie, a skeleton archer, an exploding creeper, deadly spiders and gelatinous cubes. Aside from randomly spawning in dark areas, they also spawn in so-called \"mob spawners\" which spawn enemies indefinitely until properly illuminated or destroyed. To defend himself against enemies the player can craft weapons such as a sword and bow, and protective clothing to reduce damage. When the player dies his items are dropped at the place of his death, but the player respawns at his original spawn point. Items can be recovered if the player reaches them within five minutes (unless they fell into lava).The randomly generated worlds are structured in such a fashion that more valuable resources are either rare or only spawn in deep caverns far below the ground.Aside from building blocks the game also, unlike its previous versions, offers more complex building. The player can create railway systems and ride mine carts, row in a small boat, and build pressure plates, switches, doors and electrical circuits to power various contraptions.The game features no pre-set goals and advocates exploration and construction.\n",

As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there.You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a cannon). Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bob's way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed.There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as to figure out a unique strategy for each level.",

The protagonist, Mojibri, wants to become a famous rapper.  You assist him in this as he raps his way through various stages.  Along the way, Mojibri meets two other characters - a girl called Mojiko, and a robot called Osorezan.  Although they look different, gameplay is all the same.  You only use up and down on the Right Analog Stick for all control.In each level, Mojibri will be walking along a circle of clouds.  Gameplay is similar to writing with a pen - you need to lift your brush (by pressing up) to get ink, then press down just as you walk on markers that are on certain parts of the clouds.  This will start Mojibri writing, and he will read out what he's writing as he does so.  You then need to let go of the Analog Stick at the end of the sentence to finish it properly.As with other Nana On-Sha games, timing is the key.  Press or lift your brush too early, and the writing becomes scratchy.  Too late, and it's all blotchy.  The game itself is fairly simple and straightforward, but it has a real artistic flair, and the program used to read out the Japanese text is very accurate.  If you write your name in katakana for the name entry screen, you'll hear it read by Mojibri every so often in-game, too.",

In single player mode (which also can be played in co-op with up to three friends),  you go through five areas: Shopping Maul, High School Hell, Cemetery Scary, and Evil Castle. Each area has 3 to 5 stages.  You choose one of the characters to play as, each with their own special abilities: Zack the geek uses ax-type weapons, Carrie the Goth likes swords, Andy the surfer dude uses random objects like toilet plungers and does a Neo-like spin on his weapon to kick enemies around him, and Jennifer the dumb blonde cheerleader has dual batons which can be spun into a tornado-like effect. New weapons and weapon upgrades can be bought from the local mechanic with collected items found throughout each level, and with tokens dropped when zombies die. By using their favorite melee weapon, each character can make a special attack move when their power bar is at maximum level from killing enemies. There's also 16 unique guns built from 25 different  weapon parts found in each level and with 3 different upgradable levels of power.  Other weapons include wacky ones like lawnmowers, nailguns, cellphone tazers, bicycle grenade launchers, defribulators, and CD shooters, as well as more traditional Molotov cocktails, rocket launchers, and pipe shotguns. Later in the game, even vehicles and ships can be used such as a UFO which has a laser death beam. Using the Unreal Engine 3 and Ageia's PhysX enables realistic physics-based destruction along with detailed lighting, environmental and character details. The plot is moved forward by comic-strip cut scenes, including showing the name and abilities of new zombie mutations as they first appear.  The multiplayer modes include a four-player deathmatch on a single computer, or a sixteen player game online or over LAN.",

Not surprisingly it is very similar to that game in terms of control and general design, and almost identical graphically. The character moves on a bizarre landscape, where he has to collect and use objects (with either the A or B button) to accomplish mission objectives. The game starts on a training academy that serves as the mission hub. Each mission has as an entrance with a terminal and a door. By touching the terminal with the character, the mission objective and reward is displayed on the screen. The missions available can be played in any order, but Max has to pay a fee to access other levels with more advanced missions. On the top left of the screen there is a counter for the lucky stars collected. Lucky stars allow the character to touch dangerous objects once without suffering damage. Besides that are several hearts representing the number of lives. On the top right is the inventory display, showing the two objects assigned to the buttons. Hitting START while on a mission brings up a map, while pressing SELECT displays a menu with options and the password at the bottom of the screen.\nThe game is far larger than previous isometric adventures like Knight Lore, with over 600 more detailed locations (the double of Head Over Heels).

There are no astronauts to protect, just invading saucers to shoot, but the aliens keep shooting back even after they land on the hardest difficulty. Consequently, the terrain becomes a real hazard as you drop low to blast saucers on the ground. Fuel is a limiting factor, even though there is always enough to get you to the next landing pad. The problem is that you only have one pass at the pad; there is no reverse, and while you can slow down, there is no stopping.  Four levels of difficulty from alien ships that do not shoot back to aliens shooting at you when coming down and after landing.\n",

But this changes when the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy and corrupt, with force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who must find out who wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn them into a high-tech nightmare. Mother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character (the characters controlled by the player change often) travels around the Nowhere Islands with his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is possible to \"dash\", which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies out of the way (or to ram some objects/characters). There are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based; each turn, a character can attack with his weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic abilities, others have different special skills), use an item or try to run away. The battles feature a musical combo system, where tapping a button in rhythm with the background music will cause additional damage to the enemy. The characters have \"rolling HP meters\"; when they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP decreases slowly; this way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the combat quickly. Winning battles gives the characters experience (and thus makes them stronger) and, later in the game, money (known as \"DP\"), which can be used in shops to buy better equipment or useful objects. There are many frogs encountered throughout the game, who serve as save points (and later as ATM machines). If all characters die during a battle, you can come back to life near the latest save point encountered and try again. ",

These are able to drive over other cars, destroy vegetation and damage structures. Some abilities have been enhanced, for instance bikers can now duck or hop over obstacles. Like its predecessor, the tracks are unconventional and contain multiple routes, not all of them suitable.The tracks will wear down through consecutive laps and this affects the vehicles' behaviour. Smaller vehicles also suffer resistance from vegetation, while the bigger rigs can plough straight through. Areas with water cause the engine to cool down, affecting the behaviour as well. The game can be played split-screen with up to four players.\nThe game also had online multiplayer modes but the game's online servers were closed down on 1 October 2012.",

The game focuses on two protagonists: Kisuke, a young, male ninja who has lost his memory, and Momohime, a princess that fights demon possession against a spirit named Jinkuro, who has stolen her body to fight his own personal war. Though the character's stories are separate, there are times that their paths cross.Players traverse the countryside, caves, villages and forests to complete their quests, level up, and collect swords (108 total).  Players can utilize three swords at a time, as continual use or strong enemy attacks will break weapons until they have a chance to recover after a battle. Along the way, Kisuke and Momohime will travel multiple paths to reach various destinations around the game's world (similar to other branching level side-scrollers), find secret areas for special items, forge swords, learn how to cook foods for energy, and fight huge bosses in their personal quests.The PS Vita version is a port of the Wii game. It has HD graphics, enhanced button mapping, a redone localization and trophies. In addition it is extended by four pieces of DLC released afterwards. Together they form Genroku Legends, a series of stories set in the game's universe. The pieces of DLC further the storyline, and introduce a new fighting style and bosses.",

            "Description": "NARC is a 3rd-person shooter that has the player tracking the distribution of the deadly new narcotic \"Liquid Soul\" across two different cities in Asia and the U.S.A. The player controls one of two characters - Narcotics detective Jack Forezenski (voiced by Michael Madsen), or D.E.A. agent Marcus Hill (voiced by Bill Belamy). Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds.As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their \"badge rating\" (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small \"struggle\" minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station.Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points.Players have a maximum badge rating of 100.  If it drops below 49, they are demoted to Patrolman and cannot take new story missions. The player must roam the streets in their police blues and stop enough random crimes to be moved back to Narcotics. If the player's rating drops below 24, they are kicked off the force and rendered jobless.  Jobless players cannot fight or shoot  weapons without attracting police attention. Further drops in rating cause the player to be wanted by the police, with a rating of 5 or lower spawning officers specifically to shoot or arrest the player.There are 25 hidden drug stashes in each city. Finding all of them will unlock the original N.A.R.C. arcade game for play.",

Created players can be used in the new \"My Player\" simulation mode, where the created basketballer rises from an undrafted rookie through the entirety of his NBA career.  This mode is a simulation in the truest sense, and players imported into it must pick a position on their team and are expected to play it accurately, unselfishly, and without deviation (no wandering the court in search of dunks and flashy superstardom).Xbox360 and PS3 players may download the NBA 2K10 Draft Combine game to create a player and give him a head-start on skills in My Player mode. Players can also form online crews and play pick-up games that don't affect the character's schedule, but still result in experience points.\"The Association\" sim mode has been expanded, allowing players to control and manage all 30 NBA teams at once, follow the realistic progress of generated players, share custom draft classes, and manage new developmental league teams.Internet-connected consoles may elect to receive live updates through the \"NBA Today\" feature.  This optionally updates rosters and stats to reflect changes in the actual NBA (including trades and injuries), down to offering date-specific color commentary based on when the game is being played.A variety of other gameplay tweaks have been made, including new dribbling and defensive controls, lockdown defense, a new stamina system, 24 active play calls, and the ability to save progress in the middle of a game and return to it later.",

Three different types of races are available: Outrun races pit the player against the clock and against a phalanx of police vehicles giving chase. In Speed Camera races, the goal is to hit speed camera positions on the track with maximum speed, with the average speed having to be higher than a set goal necessary to win. Finally, Boss Outrun races are duels against the Blacklist drivers, with the player gaining the opponent's car upon winning. There are sixteen cars in the game in total. Completing races as well as driving dangerously earns money which can be spent to upgrade the cars.A lot of the game content like videos and music tracks is optional and only streamed to the phone via the VCast service if necessary. The game controls allow for either automatic or manual acceleration.",

The objective is to find the Amulet of Yendor and sacrifice it to your deity. In the beginning, you choose one of the classes - there are some traditional ones, like Priest or Knight, but also unusual ones like Tourist or Caveman. Then, you find yourself on the 1st level of the dungeon, along with your pet that will accompany you and help you in combat. On each level, you have to find an exit to the lower level; on the way, you'll find countless monsters to fight, as well as items to collect. Sometimes, you come upon a shop, where you can buy or sell items. Items you find can be blessed (more effective than normal), but sometimes are cursed (less effective, or outright harmful). Eating the corpses of fallen enemies is an important part of the game, since many creatures give you special abilities or immunities when eaten. While the above description might seem brief, NetHack is, in fact, a very complex and merciless game - there are lots of ways to die. Since NetHack is a roguelike, everything is represented as a top-down view of the current dungeon level, where the walls, the floor, and all items, characters and monsters are ASCII characters. More recent versions of the game also include an official set of graphical tiles which can be turned on at the player's option.",

            "Description": "Princess Peach has been kidnapped!  Again!  Everyone was celebrating the Princess' birthday when a giant birthday cake arrived... but then Bowser Jr. and the seven Koopalings popped out and kidnapped her!  Mario, Luigi and two Toads make chase to rescue her once more.  Will they succeed?New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a continuation of the Super Mario Bros. games.  As with the original, players jump, dash and grab power ups such as the Super Mushroom and the the Fire Flower, which lets them throw fireballs at their foes.  New powerups have been added too - the Propeller Hat allows players to zoom vertically up in the air, and then glide back down, the Ice Flower lets players freeze enemies into icy blocks, and the Penguin Suit gives them traction on ice as well as allowing them to belly slide.  Yoshi, from Super Mario World makes a return, as well - players can ride him and he'll eat enemies and berries in levels.The Wii Remote's tilting feature is used to activate certain parts of levels - for example, jumping onto specific platforms and tilting the Wii Remote will angle the platform too.  Another level has players aiming a light on a boat by using the Wii Remote so that they're not lost in the dark.  Shaking the Wii Remote while wearing the Propeller Hat causes the player to fly straight up, while shaking it near objects picks them up or throws them.The game has a special feature known as a 'Super Guide' - when a player dies eight times in total in a level, a special block appears at the start of the stage the next time they play.  If the player hits this block, Luigi will take over and play through the level, showing them how to complete it.  This allows players to progress through the game even if they are having trouble on a particularly difficult level.Up to four players can play simultaneously.  When playing together, as long as one person is on-screen in a level, players can keep returning in-game after they die by floating in a bubble which is then popped.  If all players lose their lives, they are sent back to the map screen.  Another mode, Coin Battle, has all players versus each other, with the aim being to pick up the most coins while heading toward the goal.",

A single survivor tells Ryu in his last seconds that the Sacred Scroll of Bushido was stolen. With the power of the scroll its owner is mighty enough the gain control of the whole world. Thus Ryu swears to recapture the scroll and the avenge the annihilation of his clan.The game is sidescrolling platformer/ beat'em up title and incorporates most of the mechanics from the NES games: Ryu can jump and attack with his Dragon Sword. Furthermore, he can collect different kinds of Ninja Magic (which again vary form the powers in the NES games), from shuriken to fire wheels, which can only be used finitely many times, as the use up energy which again must be collected. However, instead of clinging to walls and climbing them, Ryu can push himself off the wall in this game, which must be applied for instance by jumping and forth between two close walls to get higher and higher.The goal of each level is simply to reach the end of the level before the time runs out. Each level is divided into several sections, and at the end of each level is a boss fight. After beating a boss, a cut scene is shown which continues the story about Ryu's quest for the Bushido scroll and his revenge.",

Ryu embarks in a race against time to avenge his clan against the Black Spider Ninja Clan to prevent the resurrection of the Archfiend and the destruction of the human race.He has new abilities and gameplay features at his disposal, including auto-healing, an all-new combat system that requires mastering a full arsenal of weapons, as well as upgrades to weapons from the previous game. Combat is bloodier than before as Ryu can amputate limbs from his opponents (which may make them even more dangerous), or finish them off with an obliteration move. Starting with low level moves, new abilities and weapons can be acquired and upgraded. As in the earlier game, by defeating enemies Ryu absorbs essences that restore ki or provide cash. These can also be drawn in deliberately to unleash more powerful attacks. Although the fighting is hectic it requires the player to use a strategic approach, mixed with blocked stances and dashing away.Ninja Gaiden II also features a new save point system, various level of difficulties, leaderboards to show off combos attacks and high scores, and a replay feature to share and upload online to show off player combat moves. There are four difficulty levels and the story is advanced through cut-scenes. There are also minor puzzle elements involving finding paths or keys.",

            "Description": "No More Heroes is a violent action game set in the fictional city Santa Destroy in California. The main character Travis Touchdown wins a Beam Katana (reminiscent of a Star Wars lightsaber) through an online auction and decides to become a professional killer. He has a streak of otaku, not only though his looks but also through his love for J-Pop music, toy robots, wrestling and videogames. After defeating the assassin Helter Skelter in a battle, he is approached by the French woman Silvia Christel who offers him a job at the UAA, the governing body of assassins. He is given rank #11 and needs to kill his way to the top by defeating the other assassins.The game is set in a free roaming world with open-ended gameplay, similar to the later Grand Theft Auto games. The main goal is to kill the other ten main assassins to progress the storyline, but there are numerous sidequests to earn money and additional weapons. Travis's main weapon is the katana, controlled through the Wii remote while the nunchuk is used for movement. Most attacks are performed using the A-button, while the position of the remote determines how high the katana is held. Others only become available by following on-screen instructions, leading to sword lock breaks and finishing moves. He also has a number of typical wrestling in close combat. There is a targeting system through the Z-button, B leads to a stun move and holding A and B together offers charged attacks.During the journey, Travis is assisted by Doctor Naomi, a weapons maker, and Thunder Ryu who owns a gym where Travis can boast his statistics based on speed, combos and health. He moves around on foot or on his motorcycle Schpel Tiger. The visual style is similar to the grasshopper's previous game Killer7 with cel-shaded graphics. The game does not take itself serious and the over-the-top combat and animations offer a tongue-in-cheek counterweight for the graphical violence.",

Next to movement, only a single button is used to jump, but this allows the ninja to run up walls, do wall jumps and cross large distances.Levels are divided over different episodes unlocked gradually. Each level consists of a single screen with a time limit. The amount of time can be replenished by collecting golden coins, but the main goals is to activate the exit, usually by touching a specific button or opening a number of doors. Areas are filled with hazards such as spikes and droids that shoot laser or rockets. There are also obstacles such as platforms that only move in a single direction or falling damage from high platforms. Death is always instant, but the player is given an unlimited amount of tries.The PSP version includes a mix of original levels and user-created ones with about 200 in total. There is also a level editor and unlike the Xbox 360 version these can be shared with other players. The PSP version shows the levels from a \"medium\" distance, while the DS version contains a far view and a close view on the screens. Physics are also slightly different in each version.There are both competitive and cooperative game modes available in multiplayer sessions. Players can switch between the pure mode with original graphics and the plus mode with enhanced visuals. The unlockables includes victory screens, new music and new colours for the ninja.",

            "Description": "N++ is the third main game in the fast-paced, momentum-based N platformer series and the sequel to N+. As in all of the games the player controls a ninja who combines a variety of running and jumping mechanics to get around. There is regular running where speed is built up until a maximum is reached, two types of jumping based on tapping or holding, angled jumping, walljumping, and wallsliding. When landing from great heights an angled surface needs to be used, otherwise the character is dead right away.The game consists of three main game modes: Solo, Co-op and Race. All levels take place in minimalist single-screen environments. Up to 60 colour palettes can be unlocked to alter the game's look. Solo consists of a large amount of episodes divided over three categories: Intro (25 tutorial episodes), N++ (100 entirely new episodes) and Legacy (100 episodes from previous games). The game is said to have 2,360 unique levels in total. Each episode consists of five levels that need to be completed in one session, but with an unlimited amount of lives. Each level is completed by locating the exit, which usually requires activating a switch first. There are 90 seconds to complete each episode of five levels and optionally a level can be perfected by collecting all gold. Each gold pick-up also provides two additional seconds. Along the way obstacles and robot enemies need to be avoided.Co-op is similar, but these levels for up to four players can only be completed by working together and sometimes doing sacrifices. In the Race mode, which can also be played competitively with up to four players, each level is started with a bonus. Collecting gold increases the bonus and when the exit is reached the bonus is converted into a permanent score. In multiplayer these levels are played by all players simultaneously. Players who do not reach the exit receive nothing, and whenever a player reaches the exit, a rocket is launched that can be controlled by that players to take out one of the other ninjas. When a player reaches the exit Sudden Death is also activated and respawns are no longer possible, along with a quicker decrease of the bonus and death when there is none left. If it takes too long for players to reach the exit, the You Suck mode is activated and enemies are gradually removed from the level. When a player then reaches the exit, all other player characters explode right away.The game comes with a level editor to create and share custom levels. Levels have global leaderboards, also for custom levels.",

Octodad is an octopus, but it is also a loving husband and father of two. Its family does not know that it is an octopus, though, and your goal is to keep it that way. How? Easy, by doing what a dad does, playing with the kids and helping with the house, while looking for the occasional monster in the closet and finding time for the occasional romantic dinner.However, it is not easy for an octopus to pass for a human and the game play in this game is an accurate reflection of this. Each \"leg tentacle\" is operated with each mouse button, push the button and move the mouse to move the tentacle accordingly. With the space bar the focus changes to the \"right hand tentacle\", that is operated horizontally by moving the mouse and vertically by holding right button and moving the mouse. Yes, it is as complicated as it sounds.",

Upon defeating enemies, the player is rewarded with items and experience in order to level up the attack strength and magic capabilities of the character. Players can also plant seeds during combat that will grow as they absorb Phozons released by defeated enemies, eventually producing edible fruit. Phozons can also be absorbed by the character to power up their weapon. The game features 5 distinct playable characters, each with his or her own storyline intertwined into one epic tale loosely based on Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen.",

The spacecraft controls are similar to a lunar-lander. Turn and thrust because gravity is always pulling at your ship. If your ship crashes into a mountain or any other obstruction on the ground, it will explode.To survive against the various defenses on the planetoids (enemy spaceships, rockets and more) your ship is equipped with two different weapons and an energy shield.

You can refuel by landing next to a fuel base.The main objective on each of your missions is to rescue all the Oids on each planetoid in the galaxy. To rescue the Oids, you must first destroy the factories in which they are held captive. Use only single shoots to avoid killing the Oids. Once you have blasted a factory open, the Oids will run out and wave to you. Find a flat surface nearby and land your ship.

It is essentially a bitmapped \"rail-shooter\", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to \"pick them up\". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit. ",

The U.S. government sends a probe to that universe and learns of the existence of an entire alien civilization there. However, an apparently hostile alien damages the probe, leading to the creation of a black hole threatening the very existence of our own world. Former U.S. Navy S.E.A.L. Cutter Slade is assigned to escort three scientists to the parallel universe in an attempt to repair the probe and avert the danger.Upon arrival, Cutter is separated from the scientists and is greeted by the local inhabitants, the Talan. It appears that their world, Adelpha, has its own troubles: a mysterious being known as Faé Rhan has been assembling an army consisting of Talans who think themselves superior to the rest of the population and willing to rule over them with violence. Cutter is proclaimed the Ulukai, a savior mentioned in a prophecy, and entrusted with the task of retrieving five sacred relics needed to overthrow Faé Rhan - all while trying to locate the scientists and save the Earth as well in the process.Outcast is a 3D third-person (with optional first-person view) action game with adventure elements. In search for five sacred relics, the protagonist travels through the five continents of Adelpha (plus one tutorial island). Each land has its own landscape (mountains, lakes, forests), populated areas, as well as dozens of minor problems - small quests that the hero is required to solve. Most Talans populating the world can be conversed with about a variety of topics. A large portion of the game consists of finding key characters and performing quests for them; some of these are optional, though most must be completed in an adventure-like linear fashion in order to advance the plot. Cutter is free to travel between the continents using special portals. Apart from exploration and completing quests, Cutter will also fight many guards and creatures. At his disposal are six futuristic weapons (railgun and others); ammunition for those guns is scattered around and can also be produced by mixing items. Aiming help is provided in the form of laser sights. Sneaking up to the enemy and punching him out silently is also possible. Gadgets such as a holo-decoy can be used to help Cutter gain the upper hand in combat. The player character can also jump, climb, swim, dive, crawl, and ride a local animal known as Twon-Ha for faster travel.",

The heart of the game is the Coast 2 Coast mode in which you race against up to 5 AI players on 15 US themed tracks. In addition you have to impress different girlfriends. She tells you what she wants to see (a hard slide around a curve or a close take-over for example) and you have to perform it to win her heart.There are 3 other game modes available in singleplayer: OutRun, Time Attack and OutRun2SP. In OutRun2SP you get access to 15 arcade tracks from the original OutRun 2. In OutRun however you need to drive your girlfriend through various checkpoints to the goal before the timer hits zero. In Time Attack you just have to beat the highscore of the current track. You can either race against the clock or against ghost cars.In every mode you get OutRun miles after the race. These are the currency of the game and are needed to unlock new cars, upgrades and additional music-stations.If you feel alone, even with your virtual girlfriend in the car, you can race online against 5 other players.",

            "Description": "Pac-Man: Championship Edition is a sequel, by the same developer Tōru Iwatani, done in the style of the original classic. As before, you are Pac-Man and you are in a maze with dots, power pellets and hosts.  The object is to eat the dots and avoid the ghosts, unless you eat a power pellet, which gives you the ability to eat the ghosts for a few seconds.What's new here is many different mazes and modes.  This is designed from the ground up as a console game, so some arcade traditions are lost.  The object is no longer to try to survive/get a high score without losing quarters, but to get a high score in a set time limit.  You do still have a set number of lives, which makes your time end early if you lose all them.Unlike the original or its prodigy, Championship Edition isn't broken into distinct levels.  Once you clear one side of the maze, a fruit appears on the other side.  Eating the fruit regenerates the empty half with new walls, dots, power pellets, etc and increases the game speed.The iPhone version of the game adds two additional modes.  In \"Mission Mode\", you must clear a specific goal set by the game at the beginning of play (such as eating two apples, or eating eight ghosts consecutively).  In \"Challenge Mode\", you must aim to achieve the top score for each course, but this time the ghosts have been sped up so that they are initially much faster.The look is a bright neon which evokes the classic Pac-Man but takes advantage of nearly 30 years of increased computer power.",

The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict - or are there more?Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but differs from the rest of the series by being a role-playing game with elements of a shooter. There is no party in the game: the player only controls Edge on the back of his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. Edge moves around through the game's fully 3D world by riding the dragon. In towns and some dungeons Edge can also move on foot. During battles, the player can either choose to shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of the dragons. The battles do not work exactly like in an action game, but occur in real time: the player has to quickly choose an ability to use, and also move around to attack enemies from the sides or from the back, at the same time trying to avoid their attacks. The dragon receives experience points for fighting and also gains levels. The player is able to customize the dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.",

The Star Wand is looked over by the Seven Star Spirits, who protect it in its sanctuary. However, Bowser attacks Star Haven, steals the Star Wand, and locks up the Star Spirits so that they cannot challenge his power. With his new powers, Bowser defeats Mario and lifts Princess Peach's castle into the air, taking her and all her guests as prisoners. Now, the only way to challenge Bowser's unbridled power is to rescue all seven Star Spirits, which have been imprisoned all over the land.Paper Mario is the follow-up to Super Mario RPG: Legend Of The Seven Stars. Basically, this is an RPG set in the Mario universe.  Mario has the ability to gain experience and grow levels by defeating enemies and bosses. Mario also has the ability to recruit teammates to help him out in turn-based battles. As well, Mario can collect badges that will help his combat abilities, star pieces that he can trade for badges, and more items that he can use throughout the game. The Star Spirits will also aid him in his quest.All the characters in the game are 2D within a fully 3D world. This gives the feeling that each character is made out of \"paper\".",

But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.",

Take on the role of Almighty, and restore the Patapons to their former glory!Patapon is a hybrid of a rhythm game such as PaRappa the Rapper and a strategy game with unit management such as Advance Wars.  Players control 'Almighty', the Patapons' god, as they guide them in search of Earthend.  This is done with the Circle, X, Square and Triangle buttons - each button corresponds with a different type of drum beat.  By pressing different sets of four beats, the Patapons will repeat the beat, and then perform the action, such as advancing, retreating or attacking.  If the player continues to perform beats without messing up, they enter 'Fever' Mode, which makes the Patapons perform their actions stronger and faster.By collecting assorted items, such as meat and wood, and spending Ka-ching (the game's currency) players can create new Patapon units at the Tree of Life.  These units can then be prepared for battle before the player enters a stage, to give them better armor, shields, and weapons, which will help them fight more effectively against their foes.",

            "Description": "Picross DS is a touch screen-based puzzle game for the Nintendo DS.  By following the numbers on the left and top of the game grid, players can uncover the picture hidden away.  The rules are simple - if there is one number on a line, say, 10, then you know that there are ten squares in a row that must be chipped away on that line.  If the numbers read something like 2 7, then you must chip away two squares somewhere in the row, separated by at least one empty square, and then seven squares to be chipped away.  By applying these rules horizontally and vertically to the grid, you can work out the picture using logic.There are two methods of control: you can use the Control Pad to move a cursor, the A Button to chip a square, the B Button to mark it, and the X Button to zoom in or out (similar to Nintendo's previous Picross games).  Alternatively, you can use the stylus to play.  In this mode, the Control Pad changes the functions of the stylus.  When you press Up, you'll chip squares, Down will mark them, Left will zoom in and out, while Right allows you to scroll.  The buttons on the right of the DS perform the same functions, which is helpful if you're left-handed.Picross DS has a variety of different modes: Picross - This is standard Picross.  Play through easy, medium and difficult puzzles, or learn how to play.  You are penalized with time for any mistakes you make in easy and medium modes.  In difficult, your mistakes are not noted at all.\n Daily Picross - Play a quick set of five Picross puzzles, once a day.  Each day, your score is added to a chart, so you can track whether you're improving or getting worse, similar to Brain Age.\n My Picross - Design your own Picross puzzles by drawing on the grid.  When you're done, you can play your puzzles, or send them to others.\n Competition Picross - Play Picross against others in this mode.  You can choose to use single-cart multiplayer, multi-cart multiplayer, or online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.You can also download additional puzzle packs for Picross DS by using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, including puzzles from Mario's Picross.",

            "Description": "PixelJunk Monsters is a tower defense strategy game with a tiki island theme. Players control the character Tikiman and move him around a single screen area to transform trees into defensive towers that attack automatically and to collect coins and gems. Coins are used to buy new towers, and gems are used to upgrade the towers for four different categories: damage, range, blast radius, and fire rate. Various monsters appear and move towards his flock at a central building. To complete level a set number of waves need to be held back. Contrary to similar games, actions can only be undertaken when Tikiman is at that location, so he needs to be moved around by the player. He cannot attack himself, but when he runs into an enemy some collected coins are spread around as he respawns.Just as gems may be used to purchase upgrades to towers, they may also, on occasion be used to purchase entirely new styles of towers for use. The Tikiman needs only take a moment to visit his home to get the new towers. Some towers attack only ground forces, some attack only air, and some work equally on both. Towers are again broken into two forms, physical or magical. Besides purchasing tower upgrades, towers may also be upgraded through combat experience. Tower effectiveness and experience is improved during moments when the Tikiman stands in front of a tower and dances, and the dancing is automatic when positioned on a tower. There are nine types of towers with a tenth one unlocked after beating a certain stage. At the start of the game usually only a small amount is available and additional ones are acquired by saving up gems and then unlocking them at the central building. Tikiman also earns upgrades by completing levels, such as the ability to run or plant mines.The game features 21 different stages set on Tiki Island for single and offline multiplayer co-op modes for up to two players. Players are rewarded with a rainbow for completing levels without losing a single unit from the flock and a certain amount is needed to eventually access all levels.",

            "Description": "PixelJunk Shooter is a 2D shooter in the PixelJunk series where the player controls a space ship. In the distant future the human race has colonized planets all over the galaxy and large corporations constantly launch expeditions in search for new energy sources. One of the ships receives a distress signal from the planet Apoxus Prime with large mineral deposits. A small scavenger ship is sent in to investigate the signal from the mining colony established there.The game consists of three large environments, split up into different levels with multiple areas for each one. Levels are unlocked gradually from a main map screen. The main goal is to save all survivors and collect as many gems as possible along the way. For a certain amount of gems collected a new level is opened up. A typical environment consists of a small area where the ship can be moved in any direction with the screen scrolling both vertically and horizontally. The ship can shoot enemies in any direction and a secondary function is used to grab a survivor with an extension from the ship when nearby. The grab function is also used to collect gems. When all survivors are rescued, a gate is opened and the ship can proceed to the next area until the entire level is completed. Rescuing all survivors is not required; when one dies because of the player's ship's weapon, enemies or environmental hazards, the gate still opens when there are no more survivors alive. Levels can be replayed to improve the score.Physics play an important role in survival. There are different liquids such as water, magma, ice, gas and oil each with specific properties. The first large environment introduces water and magma, the second one adds ice and gas, and the final one throws oil in the mix. There are also rocks that can be shot to create a passage. By quickly spinning around, the ship can also break through rock. Players have to experiment with how the different substances react. For instance: water cools down magma, creating rock that can be shot, gas is inflammable when combined with magma, and magma can be used to break through ice. The ship has a basic shooting option and by holding it homing rockets are activated. These however fill up a meter with four bars in the bottom left corner. When full, the ship explodes and the level needs to be restarted. The fourth 'danger' bar is also reached right away when the ship comes in contact with a dangerous substance or is shot. By moving away from danger, or by going into water or ice, the ship can be cooled down, depleting the meter.There are various ways to manipulate substances. Hatches can be pulled open with the grab function, rocks can be shot to release the substance above, and later levels introduce portals, magnets, lasers, portable substance containers that can be filled up and released, and enemies that carry them. Certain areas have a station where the ship receives a new suit, usually completely altering the gameplay. For instance, while wearing the inverted suit the ship shoots magma and needs to cool down in fire, as water and ice damage the ship. Other suits are a water suit (also used to create ice) and a magnetic suit to push around oil. The ship has to be careful not to damage itself and the substances can also be used to kill enemies. Shields can be grabbed to allow for a hit without filling the meter.Destroyed enemies leave behind three types of star coins. They form combos when picked up in succession and for every hundred coins an additional life is provided. Extra lives can be found in the levels as well. There are also many secrets areas and gems hidden away below rocks, in ice or at the bottom of pools. At the end of each large environment a boss needs to be defeated. The game includes a local cooperative mode for up to two players. The levels are identical, but players share available lives and can work together. When the meter is full and the ship would crash in single-player, the other player can use the grab function to quickly save the ship by dumping it in a safe environment, preventing the loss of a life. Also unlike single-player, an area does not need to be restarted when one of the ships crashes.",

He is sure that he is dead, yet he is also sure that he moves, thinks, and feels. Memories of love, a woman's face, good and bad deeds of his life - all his past appears in a flash, only to be replaced by the dreadful reality of the mortuary. His journey begins with only one goal: he must learn his name, find out what had happened to him, and which forces prevent him from dying in peace, like all other human beings. The Nameless One opens the doors of the mortuary, only to dive into a world full of fateful encounters, strange characters, broken hopes, despair, and hatred. Piece by piece he shall solve the puzzle and re-discover his own past.Planescape: Torment is a role-playing game that uses a heavily altered variation of the  Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Second Edition rules. It is set in the Planescape, the exotic AD&amp;D setting which is composed out of various \"planes\" of existence, with unique characteristics to each.  The game features the party-based, \"real-time-with-pause\" Infinity Engine combat system, which was previously employed in  Baldur's Gate.Character growth is handled via the standard AD&amp;D attributes, which can be raised and modified in the game. Abilities which are not exclusive to combat, such as Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, play a special role in the development and outcome of many of the game's conversations and quests. Dialogue options may become available only if the corresponding character parameter is sufficiently high. The outcome of the final quest and thus the ending of the entire game also depend on the way the player has been shaping The Nameless One during the journey.Various fairly exotic characters - including a talking floating skull and a winged succubus who runs a \"spiritual\" brothel - will join the hero on his quest. These characters belong to the traditional AD&amp;D classes of fighter, mage, thief, and cleric. The Nameless One himself starts as a fighter, but is able to become a mage or a thief if he meets certain requirements and completes certain quests. The hero is unable to wear armor, but can enhance his defenses with special tattoos.Though combat occupies a significant portion of the game, much of it is dedicated to acquiring experience through exploration of the Sigil, the game's main \"hub\" town, and performing quests for its inhabitants. The game is notable for containing a very large amount of in-game text and conversation.",

            "Description": "Take on the world in Planet Puzzle League, a simple but addictive puzzle game that you may recognize as Tetris Attack, Panel De Pon, or Pokémon Puzzle League.  Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.  Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the tiles from rising and score even more points!Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:\n Endless - Play forever until you fail.  The tiles rise faster over time.\n Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.\n Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!\n Vs. COM - Play against the CPU.  Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!\n Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.\n Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode.  Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time.  Are you getting better?  Or worse?You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Modes of play include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).",

The Playstation version uses the G-Con gun, for action similar to Time Crisis, also by Namco.The game has a distinct cartoon theme and is non-violent, making it suitable for all ages. Each stage has a different objective, explained at the start of each stage. This varies from simple target shooting (and avoid to shoot bomb), shooting cardboard villains (avoid shooting cardboard civilians), shooting own color targets (avoid shooting opposing players color), protecting the iconic Dr.Don and Dr. Dan, and many miscellaneous challenges such as the Galaxian stage where lightgun is used in place of spaceships to shoot aliens.The stages are presented in groups of 4 and the player or players can choose in which order to play them. You lose a life-heart when you shoot an incorrect target or bomb, or when you fail to complete a mission within the time limit.As well as converting the arcade game in its entirety, this conversion also offers a new Quest mode, a Party Play system and more.",

Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high ground. And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.",

There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You’ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you’re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. Finish all 5 stages in a level and you’ll be presented with a bonus level.",

However, it quickly becomes apparent that St. Mystere is quite strange... all the townsfolk seem to be obsessed with puzzles, and Baron Reinhold's fortune isn't the only secret that the town has hidden...Professor Layton and the Curious Village is a puzzle game which uses the works of Akira Tago, author of the Japanese series of Head Gymnastics books as its basis.  As both Layton and Luke, players explore the town of St. Mystere screen by screen.  Each screen contains puzzles, either hidden in the scenery or by talking to characters.  Upon finding a puzzle, the screen changes and the player is presented with the puzzle itself: the description of the puzzle on the top screen, and the puzzle (as well as the place to input the answer) on the bottom screen.  Some puzzles require simple calculation, some have a trick answer, while others are riddles.  The selection of puzzles is quite varied.  If the player gets stuck, they can purchase a hint with 'Hint Coins'.  However, these are limited - more can be found hidden in the game world, but there a set number of coins in the entire game.Professor Layton has a visual style similar to that of a watercolor painting.  While most of the game does not have much animation, key story sequences are told in fully animated and voice acted scenes.  The game also used Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to connect to the Internet and download additional puzzles for players to solve.",

Naturally, our heroes Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine make their way toward the distant dark castle, challenging - and being challenged by - everyone you come across in a game of Puyo Pop.Puyo Pop Fever is a puzzle game of the falling-block variety, the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by combining four or more of the same color, which will then vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.When an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to \"offset\" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.The game features a two-player mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.",

It does not feature the puzzle or versus modes that are a mainstay of the series, but only an endless mode.Gameplay follows the standard model: the player controls a cannon at the bottom of the play field that shoots randomly colored bubbles. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field. After several shots (in a deviation from the norm, this version of the game is not in real time), new bubbles are added from the top, pushing the already existing bubbles downward. The game ends once the bubbles reach the bottom. Removing bubbles increases the game level. The game starts with bubbles of three colors on the field; later levels add more colors, increasing the difficulty.",

You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called \"The Force\", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.",

By scraping through the first two heats (the Final GP accepts nothing but a victory), sponsors will be unwilling to invest in the team and instead of a new car, the mechanics will only upgrade the current vehicle. But winning all races allows the driver to reach the Shooting Hoops speedway with the fastest car. By combining all qualifying placements, 320 cars are waiting to be unlocked.R4 Ridge Racer Type 4 also includes an extra disk, featuring the original Ridge Racer in higher resolution.

During that time new nightmares have appeared in the world and the Magician (who was defeated in Rayman Origins) has been split into five dark teensies. These nightmares and dark teensies have captured the princesses of the land (including a new playable character Barbara) and other teensies. Naturally, Rayman and his friends are awoken once again to right the wrongs. Rayman Legends retains the graphical style and most gameplay elements of Rayman Origins. Up to four players can simultaneously progress though side-scrolling levels defeating enemies and collecting Lums. In each level there is a number of teensies to rescue and that opens up new levels and worlds. All the powers from the previous game (wall-running, air gliding etc.) are available to the characters from the start, but some new gimmicks are added, for example the ability to fire projectiles in some levels.  Murfy the greenbottle appears in some levels to aid the players. With a press of a button he operates machinery, pokes bigger enemies and opens up passages for the characters. In some versions of the game the fifth player can control Murphy's movement. The game includes regular side-scrolling levels, \"invaded\" versions of levels that need to be completed as quickly as possible, and rhythm-based levels with soundtrack consisting of humorous covers of popular songs. In addition, forty remastered levels from Rayman Origins can be unlocked by collecting Lucky tickets. The game offers daily and weekly challenges and a local multiplayer soccer mini-game titled Kung Foot. ",

Decades later, they resurface as psychotic creatures with a vengeance. Only Rayman can save the world from these mad bunnies.You control Rayman through eight levels based on three environments, based on the themes forest, beach and the rabbid's HQ. The enemies are designed to fit the atmosphere. Initially, Rayman is only armed with his fist, but he can pick up weapons such as the plunger gun and air pump gun. He can also do Sonic-like rolls, swing on poles, do wallruns, bungee-jumps and kung-fu moves. The gameplay is fast and you can ride creatures such as pigs for transportation.

They've got their sights set on the world, and with Rayman the only one who could possibly stop them, he is quickly captured.  Now, Rayman is the Rabbids' toy, made to perform bizarre tasks for their amusement.  Escape the arena, and stop the Rabbids!The DS version of Rayman Raving Rabbids is a hybrid of the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo Wii versions of the game.  As Rayman, you must make your way through different Arenas.  The Arenas give you three types of play modes.  The first is a standard side-scrolling platformer, where you must collect lums and defeat enemies to reach the exit.  You also gain special abilities and suits in these levels which help you access new areas and path branches in the levels.The second is a stylus-controlled platformer.  Rayman is continuously running, and you must remove obstacles with different stylus commands.  Different suits have different commands, so later levels have you swapping between multiple suits as you make your way through the level.  The third is an assortment of mini-games.  These can range from making a jigsaw puzzle to matching pictures on a slot machine to a memory match game to feeding Rabbids pies, just to name a few.Rayman's main goal is to earn trophies - these unlock new levels and other things.  Each level has a golden lum, which increases the amount of lums that Rayman can carry.  Most defeated enemies also drop stars - as you collect these, your level up meter will fill.  When it's full, Rayman's health will increase, and the level up meter will empty so that you can fill it again.",

The main character is Jorel, a young recruit to the rebel cause against the antagonist Arelian species. As the game and story progresses, Jorel will rise up the ranks to lead and recruit additional characters, each with a particular specialization of skills. In addition to fighting the Arelians, players will also do battle with the brutish shock troops of the Zorn, the insect-like Fraylar, and a variety of lesser creatures and robots. Gameplay revolves around the player completing a series of battles in order to progress the plot. Prior to the start of most missions, players must select the characters that will participate in the battle and equip them appropriately. Rebelstar: TC offers a wide range of weapons, including melee, assault rifles, SMGs, sniper rifles, and heavy weapons. Firearms may also offer different firing modes, such as single shot, limited burst fire, and full automatic. Other equipment include different types of body armor, grenades, power cells, and medical kits. Characters have a number of statistics that govern their movement, speed, weapon use, stealth, and other skills. As the game proceeds and characters perform various actions, they gain experience points and level up. Each level up provides an opportunity for the player to add skill points to a chosen skill. The greater the skill rating, the better the character can perform or utilize weapons and equipment.The battles themselves are turn-based in nature, with the player moving and performing actions with his characters, then the enemy side doing the same once the player is done. Each character has a pool of \"Action Points\" to spend on actions during a turn. A character can thus perform a series of actions until he or she runs out of points. These action points refill at the beginning of the player's next turn. Players can also spend all of the character's points to place him on \"Overwatch.\" On this mode, a character will spend his stored action points on firing on any enemy that comes into his view, which is useful if you wish to have a character cover certain areas. Battles also take into account line of sight, terrain deformation (ie: walls blown up by explosives), and morale. All of these features give quite a number of tactical options and considerations to the game.\n",

            "Description": "Red Dead Redemption is a free-roaming western game and the spiritual successor to Red Dead Revolver. The game is set in 1911, where players take control of John Marston; an outlaw who is forced to turn on his peers when federal agents threaten his family. He is sent to the American frontier to capture his former gang members, especially the notorious leader Bill Williamson.In the open world, the player is free to pursue to the storyline or to partake in the various events that occur while exploring the West; similar in overall design to Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series. Horses are the main means of transportation, and the player can whistle for their mount at any time. Players can also visit towns, talk to other characters, and join or intervene in events such as public hangings, ambushes and robberies. Many of these are random, including dangerous animal attacks and bandit ambushes. Other activities include hunting, gambling, duels and standoffs, with guns as the main weapon. Based on the player's decisions, two morality systems (honor and fame) influence on how the environment and other characters react to Marston. Marston can shoot while riding a horse and capture people by lasso, combined with a cover system with specific targeting or wildfire. In the recharging Dead Eye targeting mode time is slowed down to target different enemies in specific locations, and then execute the shots in rapid succession. The player can also set up camps anywhere in the world to fast travel to known locations or save their game.Multiplayer is supported through free-for-all, team and capture-the-flag modes, introducing crates with weapons and power-ups. Games start with a Mexican standoff where the survivor receives some extra time to gather items while the others are respawning, Similar to Grand Theft Auto IV there is a continuous free-roaming mode where players can team up in posses to form a party to engage computer-controlled gangs. Posses are made up of a maximum of eight players and all multiplayer games support a maximum of sixteen players. During multiplayer the characters can level up and gain access to new mount breeds, character models and weapon skins.",

            "Description": "Orphaned by bandits and left for dead on the frontier, Red Harlow grew up with a scar burned into his hand and the lust for revenge burned into his heart.  Surviving as a bounty hunter in the rough-and-tumble Old West, Red stays ever watchful for some clue that could lead him to the men who murdered his father and mother -- and then one day, that clue appears. Step into Red's spurred boots, and take up his mission of revenge.Red Dead Revolver features environments and artistry inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns films, mixed with third-person shooter gameplay similar to that of Max Payne.  The gameplay and story proceed linearly through stages, including several levels in which you play as different characters (a British trick shooter, a female rancher, a renegade Mexican general, a stealthy native warrior, and a Buffalo Soldier).  Each character has his own signature move: for instance, Red's \"Dead-Eye\" slows down time and allows you to set up targets for a rapid \"fan fire\" takedown, while General Diego's flare rifle lets you specify a target for bombardment by Diego's cannons.Beating each level will earn you reward money (and chaining together many limb shots and multiple kills will earn you bonus money).  You can spend your cash on unlockable characters (for the multiplayer game), journal entries that offer backstory and character info, or an array of canonical Old West weaponry, including pistols, rifles, and shotguns of many varieties, as well as knives, molotovs, poison and dynamite.The game features pistol dueling with certain boss characters, as a mini-game mechanic in which you time your draw to an opportune moment and prepare targets as you raise your gun.  There is also a multiplayer game (split-screen only, not networked), which you can play with friends and/or AI bots.  Multiplayer incorporates a wide array of powerups, an alternative dueling showdown mode, and two kinds of optional poker sub-games (based on stud or Texas Hold 'Em) that mix some strategy into the action.",

            "Description": "Red Faction: Guerrilla is the third entry of the Red Faction series and deviates from the first-person shooter genre that the previous two incarnations featured and incorporates an open world sandbox environment similar to Mercenaries, Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row ( which the developer, Volition, has also developed).Set 50 years after the events of the first two games, Mars has been liberated from the devious Ultor Corporation by Red Faction and the E.D.F. (Earth Defense Force) has stepped in to help the Miner Community get back on their feet.  However, the E.D.F. has become an occupying force, taking over the planet, executing citizens and imposing martial law on the planet.  As a result a new Red Faction element has been formed to fight the E.D.F. and once again bring peace and freedom to the Martian landscape.  The player takes control of Alec Mason, a recently arrived dissident of Earth hoping to make his new life on Mars with his brother Dan, only to be swept up in the Revolution and free Mars five sectors (Parker, the Badlands, Oasis, the Free Fire Zone and Eos) from E.D.F. control.  To do this the player must complete missions and destroy E.D.F. vehicles and property, lowering their control on each sector and raising the morale of the resident population.The missions range from story missions which purpose is to further advance the story and other missions including Transporter (returning certain vehicles to a safehouse in a certain amount of time), Guerrilla Raid (where the player and a group of Rebels attack and E.D.F. building and destroying it), Heavy Metal (where the player provides a distraction which allows fellow rebels to complete another mission without alarming the E.D.F.), Demolition Master (which the player has to destroy a target within a certain time limit and a limited supply of ammo) and House Arrest (where the player must rescue hostages and return them to a safehouse).There are also missions that pop-up from time to time including Courier (where the player must track down and kill an enemy spy to collect the information he is carrying), Assault (where the player must defend a certain target against incoming E.D.F. forces) and Convoy (where the player must either destroy a line of vehicles or capture a target vehicle and return it to a safehouse).  Completing these missions will drop enemy control of the area, raise morale of the citizens, be awarded scrap and unlock more advanced weapons.  To liberate each section the player must drop the E.D.F. control of the area to zero and complete the story missions, once the player meets this a final story mission will be unlocked which will liberate that sector and unlock story missions for the next.Players have a variety of vehicles to choose from, ranging from cars to trucks, dune buggys and dump trucks and even tanks and APC's (Armored Personal Carriers).  There is also a plethora of weapons including pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, the sledgehammer (the players main weapon which can't be removed), remote mines, anti-personal mines, rocket launchers and the dreaded Nano Rifle (which fires a stream of nanobots that can disintegrate targets within an instant).  The player can carry four different weapons at a time and can swap them out through access at their safehouses or through ammo boxes littered throughout the landscape.  The most advanced weapons such as the Nano Rifle is only unlocked through the story missions while some can be found in E.D.F. buildings (like the Singularity Mine) and each weapon can be upgraded through safehouses which include extra ammo and more firepower through scrap.  Scrap is the game's currency which is obtained through completing missions or destroying E.D.F. buildings and vehicles.The game also has an updated Geo-Mod 2.0 game engine which allows the player to virtually destroy a building realistically such as making it lean left by blowing up the left side of the structure or lean forward if the front is blown apart.  Players can use this to their advantage against enemies such as destroying the building from the ground floor, toppling it on enemies and vehicles or destroying the support structures of bridges with explosives, causing it to collapse with a convoy of enemies on top.  It also features the physics engine, Havok for the character physics.There is also an offline two-player mode called Wrecking Crew where two friends take turns on four different modes such as Barrel Dash, Total Chaos, Rampage and Escalation and play a certain set of rounds to win an event.  Online multiplayer games are present as well including Anarchy, Team Anarchy, Capture the Flag, Damage Control, Siege and Demolition which awards players experience points that they can use to customize their online players and acquire more advanced weaponry.  Additionally, there are backpacks for the Wrecking Crew and Multiplayer modes which enhances the players abilities such as Jetpacks, Stealth, Vision (essentially an X-ray) and more power-based ones such as Concussion, which will knock over nearby enemy players and Tremor, which can damage enemies as well as structures.The PC game comes with the DLC Demons of the Badlands included which was previously only available for the Xbox360 and PS3 consoles.",

            "Description": "Reset Generation is a turn-based strategy game. The game is based around a \"capture the flag\" concept, but instead of flags, players need to be capture the opponents princess and bring her back to their castle.Players can choose their characters, each character being a parody of other franchises' characters, each with their own special ability. The Plumber's special ability is Ladies Man, through which he can get any item on the map. The Hedgehog can travel great distances  with the special Hog Ride ability. The Level 50 Elf can lay combo tiles with her Combo Staff +1. The Babe Gunner can leap diagonally, shooting those beneath her. The Agressor, with his 4-bit Weapon attack can launch a four way laser shot. The Cyborg can use his rocket jump to jump great distances, destroying block and scorching those underneath him. Dr. Lovebomber can blast his foes and change blocks to his color with his bombs. The Monster Trainer can summon an Evil Dark Wizard to burn her enemies and to blast blocks. The Ninja can switch places with other characters. Lastly, The Sci-Fi Knight can use her Mind Trick to temporarily control other characters.Each turn is split up into three stages: in the first stage, players get to drop tetris blocks unto the game's grid based floor. The blocks are dropped in the same time for every player, so if to blocks overlap, then they will cancel each other out. These blocks give the player additional movement and make their character stronger if they are standing on them. If five or more blocks are in a line, a combo is achieved making the blocks even more powerful and also invulnerable against normal cannon fire. In the second stage, the characters can be moved and their special powers can be used. In the third stage the castle can fire it's cannons to destroy simple blocks.The game's original soundtrack is by the chip music band 8 Bit Weapon. Their use of classic gaming consoles and vintage 8 bit computers as musical instruments compliments the retro theme of the game as a whole.",

            "Description": "Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new \"behind the back\" movement camera angle and an \"over the shoulder\" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous \"merchant\" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.",

Soon they are attacked by hordes of locals infected by an improved version of the \"las plagas\" parasite seen in Resident Evil 4, which they call \"majini\". As the story progresses, Chris discovers that some old fellows are behind the whole incident.As well as including the concept of the \"las plagas\" parasite, this fifth part of the series also brings back the novel gameplay from the previous game. With an over the shoulder view, Chris confronts hordes of infected enemies that can throw objects and even shoot at you. They can be repelled with various guns, grenades, or using the knife and melee attacks if they get too close. This time though, Chris has a partner, Sheva, who accompanies him through all the game and can be controlled by a second player, with both characters having to keep an eye on each other to survive. The second player can enter and leave at any time playing locally through split screen or online through another console.The mercenaries mode, which consists of closed levels where the player must survive a given time while defeating enemies to set up chains and earn points, also returns from Resident Evil 4.",

            "Description": "Three months after the events of Resident Evil 2, Claire Redfield is still looking for her brother Chris. She infiltrates Umbrella Corporation's headquarters in Paris, where she is captured and knocked out. When she comes to, she finds herself in a prison on a remote island. Freed by a friendly guard, Claire faces several problems. Not only is the island under attack by an unknown assailant, but there has been another outbreak of the T-Virus and the island is crawling with zombies and other mutated creatures. Claire not only has to face the undead, but also the commander of the base, a mad aristocrat with family ties to the origins of Umbrella Corporation and the T-Virus. And escaping from the island is only the beginning of Claire's ordeals.Code: Veronica continues the survival horror gameplay of its predecessors: the protagonist explores the surroundings, fighting monsters and solving puzzles. However, Code: Veronica is the first game in the series to do away with pre-rendered backgrounds, using a fully polygonal 3D engine instead, which allows for features such as real-time lighting and camera movement. Still, such movements are only used sparingly, and the use of perspective is mostly unchanged from earlier installments: the camera automatically switches to different static angles, showing protagonist, monsters and rooms from different spooky viewpoints.Most of the weapons from the earlier games make return appearances: knife, handguns, shotgun, grenade launcher and crossbow are all featured. There are also new weapons including a sniper rifle, an AK-47 and several guns only found in pairs, which can be used to target two enemies at the same time. Several weapons upgrades can also be found.Similar to the earlier games, the player will not only control Claire, but also two other characters: Claire's fellow prisoner Steve, and her brother Chris.",

            "Description": "Resistance 2 is a PS3-exclusive sci-fi first-person shooter and the sequel to the PlayStation 3 launch title Resistance: Fall of Man. The game is set in an alternate history around the year 1950 where the alien Chimera species took over Russia and converted the humans into super-powered soldiers. In the first title the protagonist Sgt. Nathan Hale, part of a US Rangers task force, managed to stop the invasion in Britain, but the rest of Europe was left invaded.In the sequel, the Chimera have reached the United States and threaten to invade it. Once again starring Nathan Hale, he is now part of the The Sentinels task force that captured him at the end of the first Resistance. Just like the other members who fight along with him he has been infected with the Chimeran virus, but is able to keep it under control using drugs while reaping the benefits of the powers.Many of the weapons he can wield were already present in the first game (redesigned versions of the Bullseye and Auger for instance), as a mix of 1950s human technology and alien materials, but the arsenal is expanded with weaponry such as the Marksman and the HVAP Wraith mini gun. Unlike the first game there is limit to the amount of guns and grenades he can carry, and with no visible health system it can be replenished by seeking cover, a tactic also employed by Call of Duty 4.Multiplayer is offered in two flavours: cooperative and competitive. In the cooperative mode players can choose between three character classes (Special Ops, Soldiers and Medics) and join seven other players as the Specter Team to battle through a story that parallels the main campaign. The enemies' strength is altered based on the players' skill. While playing, new attributes can be unlocked and new armour can be acquired. Unlike the first game, co-op for the singleplayer portion is not available. Competitive gameplay supports up to 60 players simultaneously with four main modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Core Control (Capture the Flag) and Skirmish. Both humans and Chimerans are available to play and in large battles players are split up in small squads to work towards objectives.",

Tasks for games include (but are not limited to) flicking to construct machinery, releasing the stylus at the right time to belt out a loud note, sliding to rub a lizard's tail in time to a mating dance beat, tapping to gulp down dumplings, tapping and flicking to harvest vegetables and get rid of moles, and more.

In addition to these improvements Big Huge Games introduced several new features including dominances, neutral units, and capturable resources.The sequel differs from its predecessor in that it takes place in a steampunk universe spanning autumn-dotted hills in the lands of the Vinci to blinding sandstorms in the burning deserts of the magical Alin. At the furthest reaches of the continent, hidden in the deepest jungles, lie the stone stepped pyramids of the brutal religious zealots known as the Cuotl. Through the Conquer the World (CTW) campaign players strategically guide a tightly knit group of heroes across the continent pursing monsters, love interests, power, and vengeance.Rise of Legends also sports a Quick Battle (QB) component so players can jump right in to the action by selecting a map and one of the three unique races. The player’s final test of skill is to go head to head on Gamespy or LAN to explore the radically different strategies of the slow but god-like Cuotl, the fast but glass-like Alin, or the innovative but even-keel Vinci.The campaign includes 52 scenarios with 15 heroes, while the Quick Battle and Multiplayer components include 42 maps for players to fight on.",

            "Description": "Rock Band, by the original developers behind the Guitar Hero games, takes the concept a step further. Instead of solely playing the guitar along with songs, this game allows players to start a full virtual band with up to four players, with different sequences for each of the three supported peripherals: guitar (electric and bass), drum and microphone. Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics).The game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band's score multiplier.Players who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band's overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained.In the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels. Next to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content.The European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.",

            "Description": "Rock Band 2 is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game Rock Band and offers similar gameplay. Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.The original game's Solo Tour mode and the multiplayer Band World Tour mode have been merged into a single Tour mode where up to four players can cooperate, both local and online (PS3/Xbox 360). Band leaders are no longer necessary and instruments can be swapped at will. From this mode, three options are available: Start Tour (regular tour mode), Tour Challenge (different challenges), and Battle of the Bands (compete against other bands online through score tracking - not on the PS2). The game includes a training mode for the different instruments, as well as a freestyle mode for drummers where they can drum along with custom mp3 files (Xbox 360/PS3). Other modes and modifiers for the regular game modes can be selected from an Extras menu.The in-game characters can also be customized and 84 tracks are included on the disc, with many more as downloadable content (not on the PS2). It is also possible to transfer the songs of the first Rock Band (for a price), and downloadable content as well as the two track packs.",

            "Description": "Rocket League is the sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It is a vehicle based, futuristic variant of football (soccer). Just like the original game it is played in a large arena with two teams of cars. As with football the goal is to score by launching a giant ball into the goal of the opposing team. The arena has curved edges with large walls, so the ball cannot leave the pitch and bounces back, and it is possible to drive up the sides.Cars have no means of attack and no health bar, but it is possible to ram other cars to hinder them. Vehicles also have the ability to jump and use nitro. Nitro boosts are limited, but can be refilled by driving over certain sections of the pitch. By winning matches experience is earned to level up and unlock new parts. The car can be fully customized in a garage with different types of bodies, colours, wheels, decals, nitro trails etc. which is new for this version. Next to one-time exhibition matches and online games, it has a full season mode. The player sets up a season and determines the length (number of weeks), difficulty (rookie, pro, all-star), play-offs and the team size, with multiple matches in succession. Matches generally last five minutes.The game supports both offline (split-screen for up to four players) and online multiplayer. Matches can be played with two to up to eight players and online games support both ranked and unranked playlists. Multiplayer is platform independent. When playing alone team mates are controlled by the AI. The tutorial consists of several mini-games based on three categories: defence, offence, and aerial play. While playing a small arrow shows the location of the ball when it is in the air and the camera can be rotated around the car to keep track of the action. After scoring the ball is returned to the middle and the cars are flown back to their side of the pitch.",

How much Rocket, the maintenance robot, wanted to go and see it he could not even tell, but the professor barely noticed.  Then it happened.  Jojo the raccoon, sick of playing second banana to the insipid Whoopy the walrus, stole all of the tokens, tickets, and Whoopy.  There was no time to tell anybody, Rocket had to go and stop Jojo alone.Rocket: Robot on Wheels is a 3D platformer like no other.  It features 8 vehicles in 6 worlds all in unscripted, realtime physics.  As Rocket you have to go through the worlds collecting (suddenly a dirty word) tokens and tickets and fixing machines to get the park up and running again.  The vehicles are everything from a customizable roller-coaster to a paintball tank that allows you to paint the town red, or any other color you choose.  In standard platformer fashion, tickets are hidden in out-of reach places or held by characters who give them to you, after you beat them at their own game.  The realtime physics engine makes it even more interesting with objects actually tumbling and falling like they would in real life.",

The dungeon and the items in it are randomly generated each time the player begins a new game. Each dungeon level contains a grid of three by three rooms and dead ends. Levels get progressively more complex and maze-like, and monsters grow in strength the deeper the hero ventures into the dungeon.

His home planet is a great source of highly sought natural resources and so has recently been occupied by the Longardia Commonwealth as protection from the Draxian Empire. The people of Rosa are highly oppressed and not allowed to leave the planet, but fortunately for Jaster, he's mistaken for the legendary hunter, Desert Claw, by a band of space pirates. Their captain, Dorgengoa, recruits him and other various people for the task of finding a mythical planet, called Eden, which is said to hold the secrets of an advanced civilization and vast treasures; enough to rule the galaxy. But the Daytron Corporation and its president Valkog Drazer is also looking for this mythical planet and will stop at nothing to find it.Rogue Galaxy is an RPG with a science fiction background. The game boasts a continuous environment with real-time battles and no loading screens. It also consists of a weapon upgrade system that allows the player to synthesize new weapons by combining old ones.The combat system allows 'Tech' attacks which are team attacks where two or more team members can combine their abilities into a single large scale attack. A special attack, called 'Burning Strike', allows the character to attack with multiple strikes by pressing certain buttons at the correct time. Every correct button press yields another strike added on to the attack. Also, items and enemies can be picked up and thrown at other enemies to damage them. Enemies can also be invulnerable until some special condition has been met, i.e. certain weapons must be used, or an enemy can only be attacked at certain weak areas.Early on in the game, the player gains access to the Factory. This is an area where machine components are laid out on the floor, and hooked up to power supplies. This is essentially a time-flow puzzle, where the player must take into account which materials to use, how to process them, and combine them at the right times to produce a sample of an item. If successful, the item can be bought at shops after a while. New blueprints for different items and machine components can be found by talking to various NPCs.Weapons in the game gain experience as the player uses them until they're 'Maxed', at which time they can be combined with other maxed weapons to synthesize new and better weapons. After the weapon has maxed out its experience, it continues to gain experience in other elemental categories to a certain degree. A 'Mastered' weapon has its experience and elemental categories maxed out.An enhanced version of the game was re-released in Japan as Rogue Galaxy (Director's Cut). The localized version available in North America and Europe is based on this director's cut.",

            "Description": "RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 marks the series' debut to a 3D engine, and is the first major title in the series created by a company outside Chris Sawyer Productions. The new engine brings numerous cosmetic additions like day/night cycles; reflective water; improved terraforming tools; and guests who differ in age, gender and appearance (and who can be created by the player in the Peep Designer), while gameplay changes are even more substantial - construction can take place even when the game is paused; park staff now have happiness levels, manageable wages, and can be trained; shops and stalls have more purchasable items which can be changed so, for example, drinks are sold with ice cubes; rides can be viewed from a first-person camera from any seat within the ride; VIP guests can appear, with a secondary objective requiring to please them; fireworks can be created and combined in the MixMaster; new custom billboards can make use of image files on the player's computer, and custom stalls also added.The main gameplay idea remains the same as in the preceding titles - the player is positioned as a manager of a theme park, and has to satisfy the goals of a particular scenario. This time, each scenario has three sets of objectives that act as a sort of difficulty setting - Apprentice, Enterpreneur, and Tycoon, all of which have to be completed in succession. The career mode puts the player in a series of scenarios, many of which are locked but can be unlocked if previously available scenarios are finished at the Apprentice level. Unlike the previous titles, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 comes with a sandbox map by default, allowing the player to build a park using any object in the game with unlimited funds.",

            "Description": "370 BC. A select group of influential families have united Italy under the Roman banner. It is time for them to turn their eyes outward. You will be leading one of these families of Rome (Julii, Scipii, Brutii) for more than three centuries in an attempt to conquer most of the known world. The Julii are in control of northern Italy and they are very close to the borders of Gaul lands and the remainder of Europe. The Scipii are in control of southern Italy and Sicily. They are facing the Carthaginian people, who are one of the prime powers in the Mediterranean. And the last family, the Brutii hold the eastern part of Italy. They have already set their eyes on Greece and Macedonia, the most advanced civilizations of the ancient era. No matter which you will be choosing, your faction's ambitions will ultimately lead you to open war against the Senate and the other Roman factions.The game, true to the Total War series, lets you manage your empire and armies in turn-based mode. In the Imperial Campaign you command the movement of your armies and generals on a regional map comprised of Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East, managing cities, hiring spies and mercenaries and using diplomats where your military might can't reach. When the time comes to war, the game takes you to a 3D real-time environment where you control your army directly on the field of battle and you can employ different formations and tactics using the units' individual advantages (killing from a distance with archers, chasing routing enemies or flanking with cavalry etc.). Both modes of play let you make strategical decisions that affect your entire game. Each civilization you conquer will be added as a new playable faction. After finishing the game you will be able to choose from all the playable factions. The game has some pre-arranged historical battles for those who want a quick fight. These are the same 3D real-time battles but with pre-determined forces.During the Imperial Campaign it's important to increase the number of your family members. They can act as praetors, which means that, depending on your choice, they can either lead armies in battle or function as a governor of a city or town. In both cases they may offer certain bonuses or penalties based on the traits they possess and the retinue they hold. Characters earn new traits and retinue members depending on what actions they perform. For example, a general who has run from the enemy once, may find out that he is lowering the morale of all nearby units under his next command. Another element that is imperative to winning the game is conquering settlements, not only because the victory conditions state how many you must have, but also because they generate income through trading and taxes. All settlements are capitals of a province--they usually start as a village and can be developed up to a huge city, unless they are already populous by the time you discover it. An entire collection of edifices can be built, such as temples, public baths, defensive walls, barracks, archery range, and so on. Every one of them has a purpose, be that increasing the public health and order or allowing the recruiting of a specific military unit. If the public order is beyond tolerable, the population becomes discontented and will eventually riot, which in the worst case scenario may lead to losing the entire province to rebel forces or a powerful neighbour state.",

This sequel to Samurai Shodown introduces five new playable characters: the warrior and Haohmaru's rival Genjuro Kibagami, the cat-like Cham-Cham (Tam-Tam's sister), the Prussian gun-wielding knight Neinhalt Sieger, the old monk Nicotine Caffeine, and the hidden boss and unlockable character Kuroko. The game features special moves accessible by charging up a power meter, as well as other gameplay-related additions. Characters can now roll forward and backward, perform small jumps to evade low attacks, and duck to avoid high ones. There is also a parrying move that leaves the opponent vulnerable for a moment if executed at the right time.",

During the course of the game the player gets to use telekinesis, healing, charm, projection and possession powers and two types of psychic attack, plus a variety of weapons. Most situations can be tackled with stealth, mindless violence or psychic powers, or a combination of the three. ",

Besides the player manger career, you may play friendly matches, single season of any competition, and custom competitions, which can be made from scratch or based on a real one. Teams participating in these competitions can be chosen from any country. All the teams may be played by human player or computer.The DOS version is based on Amiga version 1.1 with the data of season 1995/1996. 1.1 adds the ability to switch between player-manager and manager-only status before each match of a career and improved on-pitch skills enhanced for the player teams.

After the two went out into the mountains to explore a cave, Claire gets kidnapped by some mysterious men and Jason infiltrates their complex built into the caves to rescue her and ultimately stop the Restoration in what they are doing.The game plays similar to the Metroid series. While the graphics are 3D, the entire game is a 2D platformer with an emphasis on exploration. The player can acquire various weapons throughout the game, each of them can be used to reveal new paths within the cave. For example, green rocks, hatches or doors need to be blown up with grenades, while orange ones require the use of guns, purple ones have circuitry that needs to be disabled with foam and red ones need to be fired at with missiles. There are hidden rooms within the world, which can sometimes only be reached once the player has the appropriate weapon. This means the game involves a lot of back tracking, for example to gain new bonus items, like increased health or grenade capacity.In later parts of the game Jason gets access to new movement abilities through parts of a special suit. They allow him to double and triple jump, get a jet pack boost or use a hook to cling to walls and ceilings. He is also able to run at hyper speed, breaking special walls and find gear that allows him to breathe underwater for an unlimited amount of time. The main quest is split up into separate missions and these are shown as a blue path on the map. A flashlight reveals hidden paths that can be explored by highlighting them in the corresponding weapon code colour. Killing enemies and progressing further in the game levels up Jason, giving him increased stats.",

He carries a young woman, who died from a terrible curse. He seeks the Dormin, a strange and God-like being that resides there. The Dormin is surprised that the man carries an ancient and magical sword, and speaks to the man. The man pleas for his help in bringing back the woman's cursed soul, however the being says it is the law of mortals that a dead soul cannot be brought back. He does say though, that if the man is willing to accept some heavy consequences, that there might be a way to revive her. But it will not be easy.  The hero must embark on a quest to slay the sixteen colossi, giant creatures that tower hundreds of feet above the Earth. Using his ancient sword and his horse Agro, he must travel across the immense landscape seeking the colossi to save his love.  Taking the form of various animals or bipedal human-like creatures, these colossi are tough and fierce. Their skin is tougher than leather, and the armor they wear is literally rock. However, by using his ancient sword, the man can penetrate the weak spot on them and destroy the towering beings and free his love's soul.Shadow of the Colossus is set in the same universe as ICO, and is a prequel to it. The entire game is dedicated to locating and fighting the sixteen colossi, which must be faced and defeated in a particular order. Finding the giant creatures is not always easy: the hero must mount his horse and ride through the world's vast landscapes, using his glowing sword as an indicator of the colossus' proximity. There are no enemies or hazards in the game world outside of the colossi battles. After a colossus has been found, a large-scale battle begins. Most of the colossi are huge, and much of the challenge in the battles lies in climbing on top of these creatures and staying there, while they are trying to shake the player character off. In a certain way the colossi function as hostile, moving platform stages.The general goal in every battle is to reach the colossus' weakpoint and repeatedly stab it with the sword until he dies. Since the colossi vary greatly in shape, size, speed, intelligence, and attitude towards the hero, the player will have to adapt to different fighting styles and employ different tactics against them. Most of the battles involve extended platform action sequences, as the hero is trying to climb on the colossus and find its weak spot. Grabbing the creature's fur, timing the jumps, and getting in a good position to use the sword are often essential. Other tactics include fighting on horseback, using ranged attacks with the bow, luring the colossus into specific locations to use the environment against it, taking advantage of the terrain, etc. Environments in which battles take place are also varied, including mountains, deserts, lakes, ancient ruins, and others.",

            "Description": "After the Awakening, magic has been re-discovered, and human beings have accepted the existence of those they thought to be fantasy creatures. Mega-corporations and cyberworlds had to give space to elves and Native American shamans. Jake Armitage was a seemingly ordinary data courier, assassinated by a hit squad in the year 2050 in Seattle, Washington. Miraculously, his true story began after his death. A mysterious figure approached Jake and cast a spell on him; after that, he woke up in the morgue. Jake doesn't know what happened to him, he doesn't even remember his own name. He is contacted by a shamanistic Dog totem with a cryptic message about his mission. Wandering through the large city where monorails, computers, and street gangs armed with automatic weapons co-exist with orcs, dwarves, and vampires, he begins to unravel the mystery, gradually learning about dangers awaiting him around every corner, and his own past.Shadowrun is based on the pen-and-paper role-playing game of the same name, more specifically on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon by Robert Charrette. It is entirely different from the Genesis adaptation of the same license. The game is a skill-based RPG with action-oriented combat. Most of the time Jake uses firearms; he can also learn magic spells, primarily with defensive and support capabilities. The player can hire \"deckers\", temporary party members who can aid Jake in battles, and to whom the player can assign basic commands or let them be controlled by the AI.Karma points are awarded to the player for successfully eliminating enemies. These act like experience points in other RPGs and can be manually distributed by the player. The player can increase the character's basic parameters (such as hit points or charisma), as well as have him master various skills. These include firearms, computers, negotiation, leadership, and others. Jake can also use his cyberdeck to access cyberspace known as the Matrix, for plot-related purposes or in order to obtain money. Represented by an icon, Jake moves through the cyberspace, fighting programs that protect data from intruders. Jake's success in these endeavours largely depends on his computer skill.Dialogue with non-playable characters plays an important role. Most quests involve Jake exploring various locations in Seattle and gathering information from people. Conversations are topic-based; often it is necessary to learn about a particular topic from a specific character and then choose it in a conversation with another one to obtain the necessary information.",

Ryu attempts to stop Lan Di, but is effortlessly beaten to within an inch of his life. After recovering from his injuries Ryu sets out to track down his father's murderer, as well as uncover his family's secrets and the mystery of the Phoenix and Dragon mirrors that Lan Di seeks.Shenmue is a hybrid game that incorporates elements of adventure and fighting with light role-playing. The game is set in a 3D environment that can be freely explored by the player. Much of the gameplay involves talking to Ryu's friends and the various people around town, hoping to find hints or clues that lead to the next step in the story. Any details Ryu learns are written down in his notebook for future review. Ryu can buy items from stores or try his luck with capsule toy machines, but most items that can be bought have no purpose outside of filling his inventory. Ryu can also visit an arcade and play accurate versions of Hang-On and Space Harrier, as well as games like darts and pool.Ryu is a trained martial artist, and while a true martial artist knows it is better to avoid a fight, sometimes it is still necessary. Ryu can train his moves, either by repeatedly doing them while training, or by sparring with his friend Fuku-san, which constitutes the role-playing element of the game. Fighting system is similar to that of Virtua Fighter, although with toned-down air juggling. Ryu's training also gives him heightened reflexes, and sometimes during a cutscene the player will have only a moment to press a button (displayed onscreen) to get Ryu out of danger. Failing an input prompt is not always fatal, but whether Ryu survives or not depends on the danger he was in.Included with the game is the Shenmue Passport disc. On this disc players can receive tutorials about various aspects of the game like mini-games or the battle system, watch cutscenes they've already seen in the game, and listen to music from the game. This disc also includes the option to go online to a special site where players can review world-wide mini-game rankings, get hints for the game from Nozomi, review game maps of Yokosuka, trade uncommon items found in the game for even rarer items only available on the passport, and visit the official homepage. This service went offline along with the rest of SegaNet, and all online features are currently impossible to access.",

            "Description": "After his father was murdered by a mysterious Chinese man known as Lan Di, Ryo Hazuki swears to avenge his death. After a futile search for Lan Di in Yokosuka, Ryo is contacted by Chen Yao Wen, a Chinese master who advices him to travel to Hong-Kong and seek out Master Lishao Tao, who might be the only one who knows what had happened between Lan Di and Ryo's father in the past. Ryo arrives in Hong-Kong and starts searching for a man who is his only link to the elusive murderer.Shenmue II is a direct sequel to Shenmue, continuing its story. The game's structure and basic gameplay elements are similar to those of the first game, incorporating elements of adventure, fighting, and light role-playing. Ryo explores vast 3D environments, talks to people to gather clues, and occasionally participates in fighting sequences. Like in the previous game, Ryo can train to become stronger in battles, and gradually learns new moves, which constitutes the role-playing element of the game.The game's environments are based on real locations in Hong-Kong. The game world is significantly larger than that of the predecessor. The game also has a somewhat more linear story progression with numerous precise objectives, though free-form exploration is available during most of the game. Earning money plays a more important role, and many objectives are built around Ryo having to take part-time jobs (most of which are shaped like action mini-games) or participate in fights to win money. Like in the first game, Ryo can visit the arcades and play exact replicas of older arcade games, e.g. OutRun.The sequel features a larger amount of characters who take part in the story. Some of them also accompany Ryo on his journey, helping him in fights or other dangerous situations. The game also noticeably increases the amount of quick-time events (QTEs). Several key sequences are composed entirely out of cutscenes during which the player has to rapidly press combinations of buttons in order to execute the correct action. Many major fights in the game also include extensive QTE segments, often serving as a culmination of the fight.The Xbox version of the game comes with an additional DVD called Shenmue: The Movie, which contains a summation of the first Shenmue made into a feature-length movie.

The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences. The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique \"friendship\" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very comfortable with the combat system.It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the storyline.",

In that day there was many a mighty warrior, but undoubtedly, the mightiest of all heroes were Shovel Knight and Shield Knight. Together, they made an unstoppable force of justice and shovelry ... but their journeys together came to a close when tragedy struck the duo in the Tower of Fate.  Assaulted by foes, Shovel Knight fell in combat, and when he awoke, Shield Knight was gone.  His spirit and will to adventure shattered by the death of his companion, he retreated to live a quiet life of solitude, until he heard word that the Tower of Fate had come to be occupied by an evil sorcerer known only as The Enchantress.  With the land besieged by her agents, Shovel Knight hears the call to action and takes up arms once again to defend the land, and return to the place where his friend was felled ...Shovel Knight is an action platformer. You play as the titular character, a legendary hero who firmly believes in the code of shovelry: \"Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!\" It reminds of games such as Mega Man or the older Castlevania games, as it blends combat and platforming together in a similar way. The way the knight attacks with his shovel pointing down is similar to Disney's DuckTales.In Shovel Knight gold can be found everywhere in the game, and the player will need to pay it in spades in order to buy a multitude of items, including Relics, which can be used to aid in both combat and navigation for the fee of magic points; upgrades to one's maximum health points or magic points; and different sets of armor, each with their own effects. The player may choose to destroy checkpoints for a bonus in gold.",

            "Description": "The player is cast in the role of James Sunderland, on first sight a normal person who got confused, as anyone else would, when he received a letter from his wife asking him to come to Silent Hill, their special place. The only problem is that his wife died three years ago, and has kept the secrets surrounding her death. James decides to honor the letter's request, wondering if this is a sick joke or if there is more to this. As James reaches the outskirts of the town, he finds that the road is blocked, and parks at an abandoned restroom. Little does he realize that this is the first step forward into the mystery of Silent Hill and his own past.Silent Hill 2 is a survival horror game. The gameplay is similar to that of the first installment. The player navigates James around the town of Silent Hill and collects weapons, health-restoring items, and objects needed to solve puzzles in an unlimited inventory. A radio alerts James when enemies are near. Like the protagonist of the first game, James is not very skillful in combat; he can fight with basic melee weapons or firearms with scarce ammunition. Most of the puzzles are logic-based and are often shaped like riddles, though there are a few simple inventory-based tasks as well.While the basic concept is the same as in the previous entry, the game is set in a part of town that was unexplored in it, and the weapons and enemies are mostly new as well. Also new is the ability to change the standard \"survival horror\" (character-dependent) controls into the more widespread, 3D (camera-dependent) navigation. The difficulty level can be adjusted separately for combat and puzzles.Unlike the North American release, the PAL and Japanese releases have an extra Making of Silent Hill 2 disc featuring various behind-the-scenes materials, interview with developers, Konami game trailers and more.",

            "Description": "In Silent Hunter III players take command of a German U-Boat (submarine), operating in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. The player will lead a captain’s career that begins in a year of their choice, from 1939 to 1944, assigned to the flotilla of their choice, which influences the player's initial base and submarine type. After these choices, the dynamic campaign takes over, and time progresses at a steady pace, while the player and the AI wage war against Britain and its allies both on the sea and under it.There are four main types of U-Boat (II, VII, IX, and XXI) along with several variants of each sub. Along with the different sub types, there are different armaments that are able to be mounted on/in the submarine, such as the deck gun and the flak cannon, as well as differing types of torpedoes, hydrophones, engines, batteries, etc.  Depending on what stage of the war they're in, players will have access to different levels of technology and submarine augmentations. Successes at sea will also determine the upgrades that players can make.Players can award their crew with medals and promotions, each of whom carry over and improve from mission to mission, provided that they survive (and that the submarine itself returns from its patrol).  Sailors can specialize in certain elements of the submarine, and while they are working in those areas (e.g. torpedo rooms, engine rooms, etc), the performance of that part of the submarine will be supplemented by their skill. The crew will tire over the course of each 1-2 week patrol, and careful management is sometimes required so that manpower isn't lacking when the pressure is on. Death can come from aircraft in the sky, destroyers on the sea, or even the sea itself.Simply put, this game is a WW2 naval submarine simulator, supplemented with pixel shading graphics technology in an attempt to provide a more realistic ocean and game world. The simulation’s damage model is intricate, and depending on where players land their torpedoes and deck cannon fire (and what part of the ship that's target), they will be met with varying results, ranging from light flooding of the ship to completely splitting the ship in two. The plague of dud torpedoes is modeled as well, so even if a hit is scored, it might simply be met with a loud ‘clang’.As with most modern simulators, Silent Hunter III allows the player to enable or disable certain options that make parts of the game either easier or harder. These options range from the visual stability of the periscope in high seas, easier targeting, what cameras can be used (including forced first-person), even whether the submarine has an infinite amount of diesel fuel. Because of this ability to tweak the realism, more casual players need not be chased off by the heavy simulation elements.",

Two attributes emerged from the ruins, known as Silhouette and Mirage; like Yin and Yang, they cannot exist without each other, but are fundamentally opposed in their nature and ideology. Only a Messenger, one who contains both attributes in a balance, is able to get to the Edo facility and reverse back the genetic disaster, destroying both Silhouette and Mirage. This messenger is a young girl named Shyna Nera Shyna.Silhouette Mirage is a side-scrolling action game. The basic gameplay is somewhat similar to that of Gunstar Heroes. The game's standout feature is the concept of the two attributes. Depending on the enemy's attributes and the type of attack used by Shyna, damage can be increased, and spirit (equivalent to magic power) can be absorbed from enemies. Shyna can dash, jump, crouch, slide, and grab enemies, executing combo attacks. It is also possible to master moves, acquire money, and purchase special creatures called \"parasites\", which teach Shyna various types of attacks.",

            "Description": "Sins of a Solar Empire is a 4X-strategy game similar to the Civilization Series but instead of being turn-based, everything happens in real-time.Set in space, three factions compete over the control of the star clusters. The first one is the Trader Emergency Coalition (TEC) is a more industrial and somewhat traditional faction. The Advents are instead one collective of believers also known as the Unity. They prefer to use PsiTech over everything else. The last group is the Vasari Empire. The Empire was nearly destroyed 10.000 years ago and now prepares his comeback with brutal force and highly developed military vessels.All the factions are very different in look and feel; however, basic gameplay is always the same. You start with a lonely planet and start to expand your control. To do so you need to gather the resources such as metal or crystal from nearby asteroids. Build up logistic and tactical structures such as a Trade Port, which allows you to establish lucrative trade routes between worlds, or a Frigate Factory where you can construct frigates and cruisers. Labs allow you to research advanced technologies from your technology tree.You also gain access to capital ships which are the heart of your fleet. They are not only strong and powerful, but also advance in experience and may harbor small fighters and/or bombers which help you in battle. At each experience level, the capital ship gains a talent point which can be invested in new abilities. One of the Advent capital ships for example, can disable any special abilities an enemy vessel has.If you need money or other resources fast, you can also go and trade directly at the black market, which also gives you access to the fourth faction in this fight: the pirates. Pirates not only have a well defended base of operations in every star cluster, but they also launch raids on the players regularly. However, they only attack factions with the highest “bounty,” thus if a bounty is directed towards you, you can bribe the pirates to attack another faction by offering a higher bounty.The game does not offer a single player campaign. The single player only consists of skirmish matches against the CPU with different maps (and sizes). The real heart of the game is instead the multiplayer mode which runs over the central server called Ironclad Online. There you can play against up to 10 other players and even save the matches in-between which is necessary because even a small round can take several hours to complete.",

            "Description": "Arcadia is a world where continents float high above, and people travel by airships. Among the countries of this world, the most powerful one is the Empire of Valua. Guided by its greedy admirals, Valua strives to possess all the power in Arcadia. The boy Vyse and the girl Aika are members of the Blue Rogues - noble pirates who attack only Valuan war ships. During one of their confrontations with a battle ship, they encounter a girl named Fina, who is on an important mission whose secret she cannot tell yet. Involved in the conflict with the Empire of Valua, the trio of the heroes must explore the whole world of Arcadia in order to defeat the admirals.Skies of Arcadia is a traditional Japanese role-playing game with turn-based combat and randomly appearing enemies. Player-controlled party contains up to four active combatants. During battles, characters attack physically, use items, or cast magic spells, which deplete magic points as well as spirit points (SP). Each character is also able to \"focus\", which restores spirit points. Once the common spirit bar is filled, characters can unleash powerful special attacks. Enemies may be resilient or vulnerable to particular elements; elemental affinities of weapons can be switched at any time during battles.Beside the usual party-based combat, there are also airship battles in the game. These usually occur at specific plot points and involve the player-controlled airship fighting another ship or a giant creature. These battles are round-based, with the player planning several turns ahead, using various kinds of ship weapons (cannons, torpedoes, etc.). Airship is available to the player since the beginning of the game and can be navigated physically; the game's \"world map\" consists entirely of air space, with islands that can be accessed only by airship. Most locations, however, can only be explored after having advancing the story and received an ability that would grant the player access to unexplored areas. The airship can also be customized to a degree, and crew members in various parts of the world recruited, improving its combat abilities.",

You must collect all the keys in the world to fight the world's boss.Many of the levels have a platformer structure.  The objective of these worlds is to reach the location of the key.  There are substantial stealth elements here as you must dodge searchlights and trips lasers which set off alarms and avoid alerting guards.  In addition to the main objective, there are clue bottles to find.  Finding all the clues in a level allows you to open a safe with a page from the Thievius Raccoonus which grants a new ability of some sort.  After getting this, there is also a master thief sprint where you must get from the start of a level to the exit within a time limit.There are also mini-game levels which could be kart-style racing, several varieties of shooter or assorted other tasks, such as collecting objects before your enemies do.Boss fights also run to several styles, ranging from platforming, to more straightforward combat to puzzles to rhythm to shooter.All artwork is done in a cel-shaded style and dialogue is fully voiced.",

This time he plans to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their own ways five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.The player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has their own unique version of each level. Sonic's levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic's except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can't charge up ramps or run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost frog. Big's levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed.Additionally each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby Chaos. By petting, feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into races against other Chaos. As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed to acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don't do anything in this version of the game. Finally at one time it was possible to go online and download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such a Christmas theme for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&amp;T, but since SegaNet shut down this is no longer possible.",

Two unlikely heroes (pilot and all-round ugly looking guy Dan and robot Evo) are now thrust with the mission to stop the station, and find out where it has been all this time.Sadly, not everything goes to plan, with their ship crashing into the station. Evo, the unlucky robot that he is, is thrown out of the ship and smashed into pieces. His only hope for survival is to attach his microchip into another host robot. Thankfully, underneath the wrecked ship is the remains of another robot, and with a quick fix Evo is now a robotic dog.As you enter the valley, you must contend with a host of other robots much like the dog, of all shapes and animal sizes. You can move Evo's chip from one animal to another to gain attributes and abilities, improving your chance of success to get past the killer penguins and rocket launching tigers.Aims of the game include the basic destruction of enemy robots, to sheep herding, controlling Evo the rat through a mini maze, and plenty more through 35 levels of insane 3rd person action.When the game was ported to PlayStation some of the bugs from the Nintendo 64 version were fixed.",

As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team.

Using the touch screen the player can control the movement direction of the spider. The spider can move over any surface no matter if its horizontal or vertical. rapidly stroking a finger from the spider towards empty space causes the spider to make a jump. While jumping the spider secrets a silk rope. The rope becomes attached to the spot the spider left and where it lands. If the player creates a triangle of silk ropes the inside is filled with web.The aim in each level is to eat all bugs in the level. Bugs include moths, crickets, ladybugs, wasps, etc. Bugs can be caught by jumping on them or by catching them in a web and eating them afterwards. Each level has a required number of bugs to be eaten before a portal to the next level opens. But the player can score additional points by clearing the entire level. There's various hidden areas to explore in Bryce Manor. And the player might even uncover the secret of Bryce Manor and find out where the inhabitants are.Aside from the story mode the game also offers \"Feeding Frenzy\" where each level has to be cleared within a time limit, \"Precision\", where the player must work with a limited amount of silk, and \"Hunger Mode\" where the player must keep eating or die.",

            "Description": "Splatoon is a third-person shooter set in a colour world. Players control Inklings, characters that run around and shoot ink with a gun but can also transform into a squid to traverse through the ink. The game is controlled through the GamePad with the left analog stick for movement. Next to regular means to aim, gyroscopic motion control, by tilting the device, is supported with the right analog stick to look left or right and the triggers to shoot with a machine-gun like weapon and throw large bombs. The game offers a large selection of primary and secondary weapons that can be equipped before battle. These include regular guns, rifles, bombs, grenades, a giant paint roller and items such as a shield, enemy detectors and inkstrikes. The game can also be played using a Pro Controller or Classic Controller, optionally in conjunction with a MotionPlus-enabled Wii Remote.Shooting ink colours the environment and the areas that are covered in a colour can be used to traverse quickly as a squid by transforming. In squid form the character cannot shoot, but moves quicker, can hide and can also scale vertical surfaces and swim through grates. Ink ammo is not unlimited and is refilled by transforming into a squid. Characters can jump, also in squid form with a more powerful dash jump. Enemies shoot ink in a different colour that covers the environment as well. This slows down the characters in regular form and cannot be swum through in squid form, so they need to counter it by painting it over with their own colour. There is a limited amount of health that can be regenerated by seeking cover.The game is set in Inkopolis that acts as a main hub. It offers access to different types of battles and characters that offer improved weapons and gear for aesthetic customization. By participating in battles experience is earned to level up along with a currency to buy new items. In the single-player part of the game Cap'n Cuttlefish asks to retrieve the Zapfish, Inkopolis' source of power, from the Octarians. It consists of a series of levels completed by reaching the Zapfish at the end. In this mode only the default weapon is used, but it is enhanced and upgraded by collecting power orbs in the levels. The environments offer platform challenges and enemies to take out. Each of the 27 levels also contains a hidden scroll with lore about the game world. Levels are grouped in areas and at the end of each area a boss needs to be defeated. This is rewarded with blueprints called sunken scrolls that can be exchanged at a weapons shop for new options.Next to the single-player campaign the game supports local one-on-one multiplayer matches in the Battle Dojo. Online multiplayer games are divided into regular and ranked battles where maintaining a high rank by winning provides more experience and currency. Battles are played as four-on-four matches with two teams each with their own colour. Regular battles have the Turf War mode. They offer matches of three minutes where each team attempts to cover more of the map in the team's colour before time runs out. Ranked matches have Splat Zones, a King of the Hill game type where teams fight to keep a certain area in the team's colour to get a counter to zero and win the match. If time runs out, the team with the lowest counter wins. Additional game modes (Rain Maker, Tower Control) were added afterwards as DLC. There are also special events only available for a limited time. By splattering opponents until they run out of health, they are sent back to the team's respawn point. The GamePad can be used to access a map and instantly warp to a team mate's location or to assist with aiming.The game incorporates the Miiverse to post messages that appear in-game as graffiti on walls. Through Amiibo Splatoon sets additional missions can be unlocked, as well as additional equipment and a bonus mini-game after completion.",

            "Description": "The Splatterhouse franchise rises from the dead in this new high-definition revamp!  The new Splatterhouse is not a sequel, but rather a re-telling of the original story following poor battered hero Rick as he dons the Terror Mask and works his way through hordes of demons, monsters, and other beasties to save his girlfriend, Jennifer, from the mysterious and evil Dr. Henry West.  Like the previous classic entries in the series, Splatterhouse is a beat-em-up style action game in a horror setting.  And like previous entries in the series, Rick is transformed into a hulking beast of a man when he puts on the Terror Mask.  In the classic games, Rick's primary attack was to punch enemies with some kicking involved, and occasionally picking up crude weapons, such as a 2x4 piece of wood.  Like the previous entries, players work their way through horror-themed environments inside a creepy mansion with boss battles at the end of each stage.All of these features remain in the HD revamp, but there are several levels of depth added.  Two buttons are used for punching, another for grappling, and there are \"modifier\" buttons which add sprint options and mix up the \"standard\" attacks.  Over two dozen combos and special attacks are available for players to unlock and master adding new levels of variety and depth to the beat-em-up formula.  Rick can still pick up various weapons and items, and even turns parts of his body into a weapon once the abilities are unlocked.  Rick also has several finishing moves at his disposal, which can be activated when beaten enemy characters feature a red halo around their body.Through the gameplay, players spill and collect gallons of blood and splatter from enemy characters, and this blood works as currency to purchase upgrades to weapons, attack combos, more health, and the like. Rick will show several levels of damage to his body as he is attacked and hurt featuring anything from exposed ribs to a missing arm.  While limbs regenerate over time, health must be siphoned from enemies.  With health recharging occurring largely whenever the player wants it, Rick takes damage fairly easily forcing players to carefully monitor and maintain their health during the mayhem of the gameplay.  Splatterhouse features collectibles such as pieces of sexy pictures of Jennifer and logbook notes in the form of gramophones strewn throughout the stages.  These can be viewed in the Collectibles section of the main menu.  Besides the regular Story mode, there is a Survival mode which expands with more stages as players progress through the Story mode.  Survival mode simply puts players in a stage with the challenge being, perhaps obviously, survival.  Like Story mode, there are pictures that can be collected through the Survival mode.Splatterhouse also features another bonus--which is the original trilogy, once they have been unlocked through regular gameplay.Splatterhouse is a one-player game and also allows for custom soundtracks.  Beyond original music, the standard game features over a dozen Heavy Metal songs which are typically played during action-heavy sequences.  Some bands featured include Cavalera Conspiracy, High on Fire, The Accused, and Five Finger Death Punch.",

The player controls a space ranger of sorts who's been sent to Earth's colony planet, Spore, to investigate a distress signal sent from the now apparently deserted outpost.  This barren landscape is navigated according to the standard conventions of homebrew interactive fiction: movement is dictated according to compass points and various inventory items are acquired to employ in the overcoming of small puzzles.Punctuating the landscape, however, are a series of shimmering, radiant pillars made of energy.  Entering into them kicks the game into its Mr. Hyde mode, a workmanlike Breakout clone.  Events on the text adventure stage are influenced by success at the Breakout levels, and through traversing all 16 pillars, the adventure reaches its conclusion.",

            "Description": "The modern update of the classic arcade game Spy Hunter was also adapted for the Game Boy Advance. It adapts roughly half of the console version's missions, albeit with completely changed level designs that fit with the Mode 7-style sprite scaling and rotation engine, and adds several unique gameplay modes of its own.The player controls the advanced G-6155 Interceptor car to combat the evil Nostra Corporation. The game's main Normal Agent mode consists of seven different missions. Each mission has one primary and several secondary objectives, to be finished within a time limit. The primary goal must be met to unlock the next mission, the secondary goals are only necessary to unlock further game modes. Objectives include destroying certain targets, moving through slalom obstacles, avoiding civilian casualties, activating Satcoms by driving over them, making long jumps, and more. Various enemies will be on the road that can be attacked with the Interceptor's weapons, including machine guns, missiles and rail guns. There are also defensive weapons like smoke screens and oil slicks. The weapons can be either found as pick-ups on the road or by finding and driving into the classic weapons van.The seven mission levels can also be played in Special Agent mode. This involves the levels being filled with chickens, with the goal being to drive over or shoot as many chickens as possible. An extra unlockable mode is Secret Agent mode. It is similar to the regular mission mode and features the same levels and objectives, but different placement of objects and enemies. Also unlockable is Arcade mode, a free run through a level with the goal to cause as much destruction as possible for a high score. The game also features a two-player mode via link cable. The players compete to either activate more Satcoms or kill more chickens.",

Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's \"It's Tricky\" to play. Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include \"behind-the-scenes\" footage and a \"making of\" segment.",

Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace.  But a previously unknown species, the Zerg, has started overrunning their colonies.  Furthermore, a second alien species, the enigmatic Protoss, became intent on stopping the Zerg.  The Protoss solution, however, is to extinguish all life on Zerg-infested planets, including many surviving resident Terrans.  At the same time, rebel factions within the Terran government are gaining popular support during the Zerg crisis.  The time for war has come!Gameplay in StarCraft has clear similarities to Blizzard's earlier WarCraft II.  Building units requires credits and a power source, and once completed you can direct them into combat against foes.  You only know the layout of terrain you have visited, and only the exact whereabouts of enemy units which are range for one of your units, due to the Fog of War. Each of the three races has a distinct range of units and general strengths: Zerg units are quick to build, Terran units cost the least, and Protoss units are the most powerful individually.  In a change from many strategy games, the base style for each race also varies significantly, resulting in a very different playing experience with each.  Missions vary from destruction to infiltration.  Realistic line-of-sight calculations make the correct result more likely.  A full map editor is provided, with many user-created maps available online.",

Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate \"address\" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.There are two game modes building on this basic concept:\nSkill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.",

It is said that the former was successfully defeated by the Jedi, and that Darth Malak betrayed his mentor and is planning to take on the Republic by himself. His aggression is so successful that some Jedi have decided to join his ranks. A seemingly ordinary soldier of the Republic is traveling aboard a space ship that is attacked by Darth Malak's minions. Narrowly escaping, the soldier meets a female Jedi named Bastila, one of those who have fought Darth Revan in the decisive battle. With her help, the soldier must learn to become a Jedi, stop Darth Malak, and discover the truth about his or her own past.Knights of the Old Republic is a role-playing game that uses the Star Wars D20 rule system, which is similar to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Character development and combat are handled similarly to BioWare's previous RPGs such as Baldur's Gate series. Combat engine follows similar \"real-time with pause\" rules. There are only three active combatants on the player's side (as opposed to six in Baldur's Gate). Several characters join the party and can be switched at the player's will.Eventually, the protagonist will have to train at the Jedi academy to earn a lightsaber and force moves. Force powers include stun, force pull (which pulls opponents or objects toward the player-controlled character), the Jedi Mind Trick, which persuades people to see things the player's way, and many others. The player has various weapons at his or her disposal, from the lightsaber to blasters, grenades, ion rifles, etc. Throughout the game, the player will visit many Star Wars locations that appeared in the movies, such as Kashyyyk, the homeworld of the Wookiees,  the desert planet of Tatooine, and others. Interacting with characters in various ways and performing side quests influences the protagonist's stand with the forces of Light and Darkness. The player can turn the main character into a flawless Jedi, a ruthless Sith, or anything in between. Some of the player's choices influence major events that occur within the storyline.",

As the pilot of a state-of-the-art mech known as a Vertical Tank, the player must take charge of keeping the peace. Players must master the integrated controller to clear their way to victory.SB comes packaged with a forty button controller, consisting of three separate boards, and a footpedal. On the controller there are buttons that activate commands such as switching radio frequencies, activating the windshield wipers, changing radar scanners, switching weapons, firing weapons, locking abilities, defense mechanisms, and more. The controller has two joysticks, one which moves the 'mech forward and backward, and one that allows the player to move and aim. The footpedal controls speed and braking, independent of the stick, and a third pedal controls slide-strafe.An interesting feature is that of the eject button. Encased in clear plastic, similar to an \"abort\" button at a military installation, this command can save the player's life. As the player nears death they must quickly flip the lid and push the button, otherwise they die, and death in the game is forever, as the pilot data is erased from the hard drive/memory unit, forcing players to start over.To defeat enemy mechs the player is equipped with a variety of high-tech weapons, such as Plasma Torches, Twin Pod Rocket Launchers, and a 270mm Rifle Cannon.There are a total of fifteen 'mechs to pilot, and ten missions to accomplish.",

Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)Versus - Two human players battle it out. Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.",

            "Description": "As the conflict between the mighty nation of Harmonia and the tribal inhabitants of the Grasslands evolved, a man who possessed the True Fire Rune stepped in. Called the Flame Champion, he led the Grasslands against Harmonian invasion, and eventually unleashed the power of his rune in a decisive battle, causing the death of many people on both sides. Harmonia retreated, and the Flame Champion disappeared. An uneasy truce was achieved, but the relationship between the Grasslands and the neighbor merchant nation of Zexen grew steadily worse.Chris Lightfellow, known as the \"Silver Maiden\", is the captain of the Zexen Knights, commanding its forces after a truce agreement between Zexen and the Grasslands has been broken. She is increasingly dissatisfied with the Zexen leadership, and is determined to find her missing father. Hugo is the son of Lucia, the chief of the Karaya clan of the Grasslands. When he finds his village in flames, he swears revenge against the nation of Zexen and its knights. Meanwhile, Harmonia's authorities send an enigmatic mercenary leader named Geddoe to investigate rumors concerning the return of the Flame Champion.The events of Suikoden III take place sixteen years after those described in its predecessor. The game retains many distinguishing gameplay features from the series' previous installments, including equipment of magic runes with limited spell uses instead of the more common magic points system; the possibility to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny), many of which can participate in battles; customization of a castle serving as army headquarters, etc. Tactical army battle mechanics are similar to those employed in the second installment.The game's most significant new feature is its so-called \"Trinity Sight System\". Instead of controlling a single main protagonist, the player takes the roles of Chris, Hugo, and Geddoe during the course of nine chapters (three per character). These chapters focus on the conflict between the Grasslands and Zexen, and represent three different points of view on the events. Afterwards the player must select the character he or she considers the principal protagonist of the game. The game also includes two optional chapters told from the point of view of another character.In addition to leveling up and raising the effectiveness of their weapons and armor, characters can also learn skills - passive abilities that improve the their combat performance, such as parrying, dealing higher damage, acting quicker, etc. Magic spells typically take longer time to cast, which can be remedied by improving a correspondent skill. Some magic spells also have area effects, dealing damage to enemies and allies alike. The player controls six characters in battle, divided into three pairs: the leaders of the pairs are actively controlled, while their companions act according to AI routines.",

            "Description": "Eight Olympic events feature in this game, and any selection of these can be played at a time. There is no pure sprinting, and only the rowing and cycling can be thought of as pure joystick-waggling. The triple jump involves pressing right to start the hop (before reaching the white line), right again for the step as you land, left as you land for the jump, and then up to propel you through the sand.  I high jump, after selecting a height you feel you can clear, you use up and down to control the speed, fire to jump, and then forward to propel you over the bar.For the javelin even you hold down fire to build up speed, and push left to throw the javelin, holding it left before releasing to change the angle. In the equestrian event, you must use up to increase speed, and fire or right to jump when appropriate to clear the hazards - too many faults will see you disqualified.Fencing involves moving your foil using the joystick, always staying one step ahead of your opponent, retreating when appropriate. The kayaking event involves navigating a river by controlling the direction, ensuring that all the gates are past correctly even when this requires some precise lining up. You can also load the events from Summer Games 1 in, to play all 16 events in a marathon session.",

Set in the year 1691, the game casts the player in the role of Simon Belmont, a vampire hunter armed with a powerful whip, on a quest to defeat the evil Count Dracula in his castle. Despite the identical plot, the six castle stages have different layouts and themes; also, five initial stages that depict Simon's advancement towards the castle through various environments have been added.The gameplay consists of traversing timed, linear platform stages, defeating enemies with the whip or sub-weapons that require collecting hearts and can be found by destroying parts of the scenery. Simon's stand-out ability in this installment are eight-directional attacks with his whip, which allow him, among others, to damage enemies standing below and above him. Holding out the whip will block enemy attacks. Simon can also latch his whip on special grappling points to swing over pits and obstacles. Game progression is saved by passwords given to the player after a stage has been completed.Visually, the game uses hardware \"Mode 7\" effects such as parallax scrolling, rotating rooms, and pseudo-3D objects in some locations.",

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.The Sega Genesis version features \"Original mode\" in which the player participates in racing tournaments, hires mechanics, upgrades his bike.

The Koopa King has also put a spell on her castle, imprisoning her subjects. So it is up to Mario to break the spell and rescue Peach.Super Mario 64 is the first Mario game done entirely with 3D graphics. The core gameplay is similar to previous platform installments, focusing on jumping, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies. Levels can be explored without time limits. Stars must be collected in order to unlock new areas, eventually gaining access to various parts of Bowser's castle. Defeating Bowser on each floor procures keys necessary to unlock big doors and enter other floors, which contain more areas. Mario has more moves at his disposal in this installment. Besides running and jumping, he can now walk, crouch, crawl, climb, and punch enemies. Double and triple jumps, long jumps, wall jumps and backflips can be executed as well. Swimming underwater now depletes Mario's oxygen level. Items must be picked up and carried in some instances in order to solve puzzles.Power-ups include the Wing Cap, which allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, which protects him from damage (including environmental hazards such as poisonous gas); and the Vanish Cap, which makes Mario ethereal, allowing him to walk through certain obstacles (such as wire mesh). Mario can also enter cannons and be shot from them; combining this with the flying ability grants access to high areas.",

Mario gives chase but is lost as the ship leaves the atmosphere and ends up on a space station built on the visiting comet overseen by the mysterious Rosalina. It's up to Mario to brave new galaxies, find the elusive Power Stars, and bring his friends home.Super Mario Galaxy plays similarly to Super Mario 64, as Mario explores his latest 3D world defying gravity, crossing various terrains, and even running upside down across the planet surfaces. Bouncing from planet to planet, Mario must collect Star Bits and coins, using his usual jump attacks and spins (now controlled with movement from the Wii Remote). The Wii Remote is also used to collect out of reach Star Bits and also can be controlled by a second player.In addition, Mario can find new suits (similar to Super Mario Bros. 3) that give him the ability to turn into the ghostly Boo Mario, the high-flying Bee Mario, launch fireballs as Fire Mario and skate across frozen lakes as Ice Mario. New challenges also await Mario including ray surfing, balancing on a high-speed ball, floating inside bubbles, and other challenges in his quest to get all 120 stars. Even Luigi lends a hand in the search, making valuable contributions to the adventure.Players can also take a snapshot of the worlds they've completed along with their best record times and send them to their friends via Wi-Fi.",

It's up to Mario once again to fight and defeat Bowser and Bowser Jnr, among numerous new villains and obstacles, to save Princess Peach.The basic goal of each level is to collect the golden star, either by reaching an end goal, collecting a number of smaller star bits or defeating an end level boss. The environment is a mixture of standard Mario stages filled with familiar evil characters and miniature planetoids with their own orbital gravity. Certain levels switch the perspective from 3D to 2D, mimicking the platform origins of the character, while others range from molten lava wastelands, ice caverns or oceans. Unlike Super Mario Galaxy, Galaxy 2 features a more standardised level system, a number of galaxies split into smaller planetary levels that can only be reached by completing one planet, to open up the path to the next. To reach an end level boss or open a bonus planet, you need to have discovered enough golden stars to unlock it. The hub world of the original has been replaced with a spaceship, shaped like Mario's head, which can be used to travel between Galaxies, as well as discover hidden 1-Ups. Galaxy 2 features further improvements in gameplay, with two new suits for Mario and the return of his faithful companion Yoshi. Mario's first new suit is the Cloud Suit, which allows him to create three safe but temporary cloud platforms. The second new suite is the Rock Suit which, while wearing it, allows Mario to roll up into a rock ball, which will be necessary to complete some challenges or defeat certain foes. Yoshi adds an element of speed, can eat most enemies in sight, and can reach higher areas that Mario cannot reach alone. The green dino can also eat certain fruit to bolster his move set, but only for a brief moment of time, such as a speed boost, the ability to float higher into the air, or to see invisible platforms, especially handy in a Ghost House.Like the original Super Mario Galaxy a second player can join the experience by pointing the Wii Remote on the screen to collect coins or fling star bits, however this time they can also collect items that are out of the reach of Mario or Yoshi, and push back enemies in advance of the hero.To aid those too young or new to the franchise, a second DVD explains the ins and outs of the control system. Plus, if you get stuck along the way, you can also turn on the Super Guide, which gives control of Mario over to the AI to complete a tricky level for you. However, you don't win a proper star as a reward, only a bronze star. Various 'Hint TV's' are also dotted around certain levels to explain or introduce a new element to the gameplay.",

This game starts off like almost every other Mario game, with Bowser kidnapping Princess Toadstool. However, when Mario goes to Bowser's Keep to save her, a giant sword made by the evil Smithy crashes into the castle and sends Mario, the Princess, and Bowser flying to separate parts of the world.The game plays much like a traditional RPG: Mario and the members of his party gain experience points by defeating enemies. These experience points can increase the team's maximum number of hit points and flower points (magic points). The battles are also turn-based, but this time there are timed attacks and defenses. Timed attacks allow you to inflict more harm than normal to an enemy. Timed defenses, on the other hand, allow an enemy to inflict less harm than normal. You are only allowed to have three out of five team members on your party at a time. Mario is always in your party, regardless. Your team members can also purchase more weapons and abilities, along with better armor.",

Only a single Metroid larva remained. Samus took it to a galactic research station, and scientists assured her that the powers of the larva can be harnessed to help people. However, everything goes wrong when a dragon kills the scientists, takes away the larva, and destroys the research facility. Samus follows the dragon to the planet of Zebes, where she fought Mother Brain before. She must explore the dangerous planet, stay alive, and figure out a way to retrieve the larva.Super Metroid is a platform game and a follow-up to Metroid II. Like the previous games in the series, it is not divided into separate levels; the planet Zebes is an open world which Samus traverses back and forth. This world is divided into rooms separated with doors which must be shot to be opened. Shooting is also used to open up secret passages, some of which contain nifty bonuses, but finding most of them is required to proceed in the game. There are many items to find on the way, and each new item usually makes heretofore inaccessible areas available to Samus. The items include both weaponry (such as missiles, super missiles, or upgrades to Samus's standard laser gun), energy tanks that increase Samus' max health, and other gadgets (like a grappling hook that allows Samus to stick to the ceiling). There are various enemies - alien fauna - lurking around planet Zebes. The enemies all respawn after re-entering a room, though Samus' increasing capabilities mean that they become easier to defeat as the player makes progress. After killing them, the enemies typically leave behind some health or ammo. ",

Instead, the game is won when a player manages to knock the opponent off the stage, although some games modes only award a point to the victorious player, continuing the fight. The fighting itself does have an influence however. The character's vitality is represented by a percentage. Starting at zero, the higher it becomes, the further the character flies away when hit, improving the chances to have him disappear off the stage. Characters have certain recovery moves to get back, but each stage has a certain boundary from where no return is possible.Each character has basic and advanced attacks (smash attacks), as well as character-specific special moves. They can also make use of items, projectiles, custom weapons and other items. This edition introduces super attacks referred to as final smashes. Activated by destroying smash balls, these feature powerful and often unstoppable attacks, regularly introducing a major transformation of the character. Other help is introduced through assist trophies (a computer-controlled character temporarily helping out) and Poké balls (a character from the Pokémon universe joins the fight).The single-player mode is called The Subspace Emissary and features cut-scenes with all playable characters. It is team-based, and new characters will temporarily join or leave the team for which the player can determine the battle order. Other modes include Classic (a series of matches), Events with pre-determined battle conditions - also for co-op, and the Stadium mode with mini-games such as Home-Run Contest and Target Smash!There are 35 playable characters in total (both old and new, with some removed from previous iterations), and certain characters can acquire alternate fighting styles or transformations making a total of 37 selectable. There are 23 characters available right away:\nBowser (Mario games)\nDiddy Kong (Donkey Kong games)\nDonkey Kong (Donkey Kong games)\nFox (Star Fox series)\nIce Climbers (Ice Climber)\nIke (Fire Emblem series)\nKing Dedede (Kirby games)\nKirby (Kirby games)\nLink (Legend of Zelda series)\nLucas (Mother/EarthBound series)\nMario (Mario games)\nMeta Knight (Kirby games)\nOlimar (Pikmin series)\nPrincess Peach (Mario games)\nPikachu (Pokémon universe)\nPit (Kid Icarus)\nPokémon Trainer (Pokémon universe)\nSamus (Metroid series)\nSheik (Legend of Zelda series)\nWario (Wario series)\nYoshi (Yoshi series)\nZelda (Legend of Zelda series)\nZero Suit Samus (Metroid series)Additionally, 14 characters can be unlocked:Captain Falcon (F-Zero series)\nFalco (Star Fox series)\nGanondorf (Legend of Zelda series)\nJigglypuff (Pokémon universe)\nLucario (Pokémon universe)\nLuigi (Mario games)\nMarth (Fire Emblem series)\nMr. Game &amp; Watch (Game & Watch series)\nNess (Mother/EarthBound series)\nR.O.B.

The world map consists of 50 regions, each containing one level (two training levels are also available). The stages are presented in isometric view, and one to four agents are controlled. Unlike the indirect cursor control in the computer versions, on the consoles the agents are controlled directly, with potential targets being selected automatically. Unlike the multi-layered versions of the computer game, all levels consist of one layer only.Between missions, taxes from conquered territories can be spent on researching new weapons and cybernetic upgrades for the agents. These are all the same as on the computer versions, with the exception of the flame thrower, which has been replaced with the less gruesome 'chiller'. Indirect control of the agents with drugs influencing adrenaline, perception and intelligence also remains the same. The policemen and guards from the original are gone, their place being taken by robotic drones.",

The fatally wounded boy is approached by the Devil, who offers him his life and a chance to become a fearsome fighter in exchange for his soul. Determined to get even with his father, Kazuya agrees. Twenty-one years later Heihachi, now the head of a corrupt corporation, organizes a fighting championship his son is eager to join.Tekken is a versus fighting game similar in concept to Virtua Fighter. Besides Kazuya, other fighters of the tournament all have their own range of moves, something to prove, and a reason for any combat opponent to fear them. For example, Nina Williams is a trained assassin, Yoshimitsu is a robotic recreation of a ninja, and Marshall Law aims to set up a fighting school to pass on his knowledge. As one of these eight figures, the player must come through fights in a 360-degree 3D environments with texture mapped backdrops and polygon graphics. After beating the seven rivals there are two bosses to beat. There are three difficulty levels, and fight lengths and number of rounds can be varied.Each limb's movement is controlled with a different button, making finding the right combos a matter of instinct and planning rather than experimentation. Pure martial arts inspire most of the moves. Tekken also introduced the ability to dodge an opponent's attack to versus fighting games, made possible by the 3D perspective. The slow-motion replay of the final moves allows the player to see where and what went right or wrong.",

On his nineteenth birthday, Heihachi announces the King of the Iron Fist Tournament 3, hoping to use Jin to remove Ogre out of his way.Tekken 3 is a versus fighting game similar to its predecessors in the series. Differences include prominently featured side-stepping, allowing characters to retreat into the background and back during fights, new combo throws, and reduced jumping capabilities aiming for more realistic combat.

The characters do not have different statistics, that only applies to the extravagant, licensed cars.The whole island is accessible from the beginning and after the player has bought his first home and car, he can either drive around and look for events or load up the map and jump directly to a location of a race, a car salesman or other locations - similar to Need for Speed Underground. Every bought car has a built-in navigation system, guided by a woman's voice to get the player to his destination, either pre-programmed in the game or decided by the player.There are over 125 different cars and motorcycles in different price ranges to choose from. From the Audi TT over the Jaguar XJ200 to the McLaren F1 and Kawasaki Z1000, there is everything the character needs as a young man or girl with too much money on their hands. Each car has its own, realistic set of characteristics such as speed or handling, but they all have a highly detailed exterior and interior in common.The character starts with $200.000 dollars in his pocket, but there will not be anything left after buying a first car and home. Additional cash needs to be earned in different kinds of races from checkpoint challenges to time trials. The money cannot only be used to buy new homes and new cars (and a little tuning for those), but also to buy new outfits for the avatar.The heart of Test Drive Unlimited is the online mode. Using a GameSpy account, players connect to the official TDU server immediately after loading the game. New options become available online, such as a meeting lounge where the statistics and looks of other players can be looked up. It also provides access to player-created matches shown on the map screen. Creating a race  here also works in the singleplayer modes. At any location, the start and finish can be defined, as well as the type of the race, which type/classes of cars or bikes are allowed and how many people can participate. If not all slots have been filled up by other players, the AI will take control of the rest.The PSP and PS2 versions have a lower visual quality and lack a few features, such as manual transmission, avatar customization, certain cars and all motorcycles, dealership and tuning shop NPCs, the vehicle interior camera angle and certain missions. They do include Master Points and Auto GPS, and certain default vehicles only available for the 360 version through download packs.",

The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.Compared to other versions, the C64 adaptation differs in a few aspects: the well is 21 blocks high instead of the standard 20. Unlike in other early versions, clearing rows increases the score and a preview of the next piece to appear is always in view and cannot be toggled off for bonus points.Options are simple: the starting level can be set from 0 to 9, and there is a choice between music (a continuous piece of 26 minutes in length) or sound effects during gameplay. There is a high score table with room for 15 names.",

The standard tetris mode has a ghost shape at the bottom of the screen so you can see where the block will land, you can see the next four blocks and you can hold a block for later use.In single player you can choose Marathon, Computer Battle, Field Climber, Shadow and Stage Racer.Marathon is an endless game where you have to get as many lines as possible. Computer Battle is the same except against a computer opponent. Field Climber is a Lemmings-like, similar to the gameplay in Tetris Plus. A tiny person walks at the bottom of the screen, you have to help him climb all the way to the top by laying out blocks to form stairs, but be careful not to squash him. Shadow is a game where you have to fill in a shadow figure with blocks. You have to try to make a perfect overlap with no blocks outside the silhouette. In Stage Racer you have to manoeuvre a single block down a vertically scrolling screen. Move and rotate it so that it doesn't get stuck, because when it touches the top of the screen it's game over.Multiplayer offers the following games: VS Battle, VS Field Climber, VS Hot Lines, VS Shadow, Co-op Tetris and Duel Spaces.VS Battle, VS Field Climber, VS Hot Lines and VS Shadow are all battle versions of the single player games. You can gain power-ups that temporary freezes the opponents game or temporary stops them from rotating their blocks. In VS Hot Lines you have to clear certain lines indicated in green, which are typically not at the bottom of the screen. Once you clear a green line it disappears, clear all green lines to win the game. Co-op Tetris and Duel Spaces are both played in a larger area, 20 blocks wide. In Co-op Tetris two players work together to form lines. In Duel Spaces two players take turns dropping tetrominoes. Each player must try to seal off sections in the grid and capture as grid space as possible.You can also play online in World Battle or Friend Battle using Wi-Fi, and you can play using the Wii Balance Board.",

            "Description": "The 7th Guest is a puzzle-adventure game which takes place inside an abandoned mansion. Venture into the 22 rooms of the spooky mansion, solve over 20 mind-bending puzzles to unravel a tale of revenge and horror that took place in the 1930s.The owner of the mansion was Henry Stauf, a famous maker of children's toys. Once a homeless drifter and thief, influenced by a vision in a dream, Henry invented a wondrous doll, so incredibly life-like that it sold like wildfire. Stauf's toys became popular overnight bringing fame and fortune and changing his rags to riches. But things took a tragic turn when owners of the doll became infected with a fierce and deadly virus. None of those children recovered.After this turn of events Stauf secluded himself inside his estate, stopped making his toys and never came into contact with the outside world for a long time. Something very strange happened when six people receive an invitation to a party at the mansion. By solving the riddles inside Stauf's \"fun house\", you'll delve into the past to learn what happened to them, and the mysterious 7th guest, on that fateful night.The game is played in first person perspective with a point-and-click interface featuring horror-themed animated cursors (skeletons, bulging-eye skulls etc.). It is one of the first games to be released on the then-new CD-Rom media. The graphics are fully rendered in SVGA, and real actors and actresses bring the story to life during numerous full-motion video cut scenes. The visuals are accompanied by an original, orchestrated musical score.To finish the game, you must solve the puzzles in Stauf's manor; each solved puzzle will unlock new rooms or new movie sequences to watch. The puzzles are quite varied; there's the classic \"eight queens puzzle\", another puzzle where you need to compose a sentence by rearranging letters, and others. If you get stuck, you can visit the library; a book within will give you hints on the puzzle. If the hints aren't enough, the puzzle will solve itself automatically once you consult the book enough times. Some later, limited releases of the game came with a separate video that included a \"behind the scenes\" look at the making of the game and interviews with the developers.",

One day, a group of peasants approach the castle, and the elder tells Gabriel about a terrible death of a little girl, who was killed by a vicious wolf. Suspecting the wolf could be a supernatural creature, the peasant asks the Schattenjaeger to purge the evil. The investigation brings Gabriel and his assistant Grace Nakimura to the mysterious Hunter Society and to Bavaria's dark past.The game utilizes a cast of live actors and full-motion video technology: the actors are filmed over photorealistic images of Munich and its surroundings, and nearly every interaction with the environment leads to a FMV sequence. Despite its visual style, The Beast Within is not an interactive movie, but a full-fledged adventure game with many dialogues, detective work to do, and puzzles to solve. Unlike the first game, it is entirely controlled through point-and-click actions - all the icons have been replaced by a single cursor. Both Gabriel and Grace are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.",

Whilst the game attempts to capture the spirit of significant periods in the band's history some liberties were taken in the presentation; for example Ringo Starr is shown playing the drums on Back in the U.S.S.R. despite not appearing on the actual recording and the studio versions of songs are used in the Live at the Budokan section. Along with the now classic guitar, bass, drums, and vocals parts, the title adds the possibility to have three separate vocals parts, where each singer gets to sing in a different harmony.The game features 45 remastered Beatles titles, and further albums will be released, available for purchase through DLCs and exclusive to The Beatles: Rock Band. This is the first time that Apple Corps allowed the Beatles’ music to feature in a video game.Contrary to the AC/DC game which looked just like the original Rock Band, the entire game is skinned in a Beatles theme: characters, overall look and feel, sound effects. Skinned instruments were also released. Also still contrary to the AC/DC game, it is not possible to export the songs to play in Rock Band or Rock Band 2.The tracklist:Singles\nI Want to Hold Your Hand\nI Feel Fine \nDay Tripper\nPaperback Writer\nRevolution\nDon't Let Me DownPlease Please Me (1963)\nI Saw Her Standing There\nBoys \nDo You Want to Know a Secret\nTwist and Shout\nWith the Beatles (1963)\nI Wanna Be Your Man\nA Hard Day's Night (1964)\nA Hard Day's Night\nCan't Buy Me Love\nBeatles For Sale (1964)\nEight Days a Week\nHelp!

            "Description": "The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena includes two single player campaigns. One is a graphically enhanced version of The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and the other, called Assault on Dark Athena, continues the story almost directly after the end of Escape from Butcher Bay with Richard B. Riddick and Johns in hibernation on board of a ship deep in space. A group of renegade mercenaries finds them and brings them on board of their giant ship called the Dark Athena where they transform people into mindless drones. Of course Johns is a too valuable target to transform so they plan to collect the bounty that is on his head after he freed Riddick from the prison. Riddick on the other hand - well he managed to evade capture and is now really pissed.As in the first campaign, the player once again assumes the role of Riddick, controlling him a standard first person shooter fashion through the corridors of the ship. But Riddick isn't one who runs guns blazing through the enemies. Instead the dark is his friend. Hiding in the shadows he uses his special ability to see in the dark, sneak up on enemies and perform an instant melee kill with whatever weapon he has currently equipped. This not only applies to his melee weapons that range from his fists to the newly double-carved blades but called \"Ulaks\" but also to the bigger stuff he'll find on his journey like assault rifles, a mini-gun and such. If he hasn't a gun available, he can pick up a dead drone and use hers. At one point in the single player campaign he'll even take over the control of a full-blown mech to reek havoc on the ship as he did back in Escape from Butcher Bay. If an enemy manages to actually hit the player, Riddick can use NanoMED health units to replenish his health. Since these only have a limited amount of charges he can refill them with NanoMED Catridges scattered around the levels. The bigger NanoMED health units permanently increase his health. And on his way through the Dark Athena he also finds bounty cards, the equivalent of the cigarette packs Riddick collects in Escape from Butcher Bay, unlocking extra content like artworks or personal profiles. Completely new to the game is the multiplayer mode allowing up to 12 players compete against each other in several game modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Arena. Butcher Bay Riot and Pitch Black. While the first three are self-explanatory, Arena puts up to four players in small areas in either one-on-one or two-on-two fights while everyone else is spectating and waiting for their turn. Butch Bay Riot on the other hand puts three teams against each other with each team buying their weapons, ammo and armor before each round. With the goal to bring the power node located in the middle of the map to the enemy base, the guards, prisoners and mercenaries don't really fight each other at once. Instead each group has one specific enemy. So the prisoners go after the guards base while the guards attack the mercs. The last game mode, Pitch Black, puts everyone in a dark area with one player playing Riddick with his dual-blades and his night-vision ability and the others all playing mercs only equipped with their weapons and flashlights hunting him down.",

Will you be the first?As Riddick, you must find your way out of the prison and to safety.  You begin in a cell, and soon, hell breaks out.  You are left with nothing to defend yourself, so you must find a machine which will allow you to use guards weapons, otherwise you will be shocked, as they are DNA protected.Throughout your adventure, you will explore the prison complex, caverns, mines, the triple-security area, and even the palace area, where all of the administration is housed.To help you escape, you will have access to a small but deadly arsenal of weapons, such as a pistol and machine gun.  There are a number of melee weapons available too, like a wrench or shiv (shard of glass).You will have to take on several different enemies, from guards to prisoners to robotics to mutated humans, also called 'dwellers' who lives deep below under the prison.Vin Diesel voices Riddick.  The game is a prequel to the 1999 film Pitch Black, which first introduced Vin Diesel as Richard Riddick, the anti-hero.",

Jackie Estacado, a Mafia hit man in modern New York City, becomes possessed by an ancient evil on his 21st birthday. The curse has been passed down through the generations in his family to the first born, starting with his great great grandfather. Jackie is about to be taken out by the henchmen of Mafia don Paulie Franchetti when the curse grants him supernatural powers. He is able to eliminate the hit men and goes after Paulie next, as the Mafia don wants to kill his girlfriend Jenny Romano.The game offers a mixture of classic first-person shooting with regular weapons, along with the powers of The Darkness. The latter cannot be used in well-lit environments. In dark areas, Jackie can combine both powers. Jackie can switch back and forth during gameplay, and as The Darkness, the viewpoint is placed lower, but with a broader point-of-view. Darkness powers allow Jackie to summon darklings (different types of creatures), summon dark tentacles that grow from his back to break through barriers and smash opponents, along with maw tentacles for close combat. Estacado can also create a black hole and force it to collapse on itself for wide-range damage, and summon darkness guns that fire lightning bolts.The game takes place in a modern environment, but also in the fictional Otherworld and Hell. The Darkness manifests itself as a voice in Jackie's head and tries to gain complete control of the body. The force feeds on the dark and requires a live human body to exist.",

Boston Low, a NASA veteran, is sent to command a space expedition on the asteroid. Accompanied by the journalist Maggie Robbins and the archaeologist Brink, Boston investigates the asteroid and finds a strange structure that undoubtedly belongs to an alien civilization. During the course of investigations, the team finds itself on a seemingly deserted planet. They have no knowledge of the planet and no possibility of going back. Will they ever discover the secret of this strange world and find a way to get home?The Dig is a point-and-click adventure game with a simple one-cursor interface. Most of the puzzles are inventory-based, tending to be somewhat more complex than in most preceding LucasArts' adventure games. There are also a few logic-based puzzles, which require understanding and manipulation of alien technology and life forms on the planet. Traditional branching dialogue system is utilized; however, the game focuses more on puzzle-solving than on conversations to advance the plot. The game's story is influenced by science fiction literature and movies, and strives to be realistic, departing from the comedy style of LucasArts' adventures. Despite that, humorous elements are present in some of the dialogues and text descriptions. The game utilizes hand-drawn graphics with a few pre-rendered 3D images.",

            "Description": "A lowly prisoner has been cast into the depths of the dungeon in the Imperial capital of the province Cyrodiil. The fate of this prisoner suddenly changed when the Emperor Uriel Septim descended into the prison with his guards, fleeing from unknown assassins who have already slaughtered his children. But even an emperor cannot escape his destiny. Before the last assassin delivered the lethal strike, the old emperor entrusted the prisoner with the Amulet of Kings and asked him to find his illegitimate son, the last of the Septim bloodline. The Septims and the Amulet are the last barrier between the continent Tamriel and the dark dimension of Oblivion, and the delicate balance is threatened by the Daedra Prince of Destruction, Mehrunes Dagon, the prisoner being Tamriel's only hope.Oblivion is the fourth title in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series. The game sticks to the style of its predecessors featuring action-based combat, first-person and third-person views, and vast free-roaming environments. The player's chosen race and class determine the abilities the protagonist has in the beginning. The game allows the player to develop multiple types of characters without being limited to a specific role. The advancement system, as was the case in previous games, is based on skill usage. When the player repeatedly use one of the skills, it improves. NPCs offer training (for a price) to help in advancing to the next stage. In time the protagonist can become an Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert and Master and gain certain bonuses for the skill. The skills of the foes are \"levelled\" to be approximately equal to or slightly above those of the main character.There are numerous side quests which help the hero advance his or her abilities as well as gain fame. The player is free to roam the world without a particular goal, exploring towns, forts, caves, mines, and old temple ruins. Visiting shrines scattered around Tamriel grants the protagonist specialized skills, some permanent and some temporary.Weapons and armor wear out with use and need to be repaired either with the help of special non-playable characters or by using an appropriately trained Armorer skill. Enhanced items (weapons, armor, clothing, rings, amulets) abound in the game for protection, resistance, reflection and special activities like walking on water, exploring underwater, becoming invisible or lightening the load. It is possible to open the gates to the Oblivion realm to grab their sigil stones, which can be used to make enhanced items. Higher-level mages can create their own spells, and enchant weapons, armor and clothing using filled soul gems in addition to sigil stones.As opposed to Morrowind, mana points gradually regenerate over time, without the need to rest to replenish them. Active blocking has been added to melee combat. The game features full voice acting for all the NPCs. Dialogues typically contain less topics than in Morrowind, but more responses unique to different characters. In addition, the so-called \"radiant AI\" system makes characters follow their own schedules, engage in various activities or talk to each other regardless of the player's input. The game features fast traveling, allowing the player to instantly visit Cyrodiil's major cities or previously explored areas.",

            "Description": "Two hundred years after the events described in Oblivion, the continent of Tamriel is in turmoil. The Emperor's throne remained without heir; the Blades, Empire's elite guards, have been disassembled; elven nations began capturing territory from the Empire. The assassination of the King of Skyrim, Tamriel's Northern-most province and home of the Nord race, led to a civil war between those who wish independence for Skyrim and those who wanted it to remain under the Empire's control. A prisoner is brought to a small town, awaiting execution for alleged involvement with the Stormcloaks, a group that was founded by the king's assassin Ulfric Stormcloak. Just before the executioner's axe lands on the prisoner's neck, a dragon attacks the city, forcing most people to flee. The unexpected freedom leads the ex-prisoner into the snowy Skyrim, where the rumors of the dragon begin to circulate.Like its predecessors in the Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim is an open-ended role-playing game with action-based combat. The player may explore the vast environments of Skyrim from either first- (default) or third-person perspective, being unrestricted in his or her travels and free to undertake any side quests in any order, or follow the main quest. It is possible to fast-travel to previously visited locations directly from the world map. The player can also opt to buy (or steal) and ride a horse.There are ten races to choose from:  Altmer (High Elves), Argonian (reptile people), Bosmer (Wood Elves), Breton, Dunmer (Dark Elves), Imperial, Khajiit (cat people), Nord, Orc, and Redguard.  Each race has their own perks and limitations, such as Nord being resistant to cold, Khajiit being weak with magic, etc. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player cannot choose a class for the main character; rather, the latter evolves into any class-like combination gradually, according to the play style. When the protagonist reaches a new level, the player may increase his or her Health, Magicka, or Stamina and a new perk may be added to one of the skills. There are eighteen skills altogether, and each skill has several levels and perks which may be obtained.  Most perks are only accessible after a certain level has been reached in said perk.  For instance, in order to reach higher perks with Destruction, destructive spells must be leveled up.  Skill levels can increase either through extensive use, skill books, or even paying for training from certain non-playable characters.  The game contains some features that were introduced in Fallout 3. Enemy level-scaling is done in a similar way, as opposed to the more intrusive system of Oblivion. The player may hire other fighters to follow the hero around and lend a helping hand in combat.  Also, the lockpicking system of the previous installment has been replaced by the lockpicking methods of the recent Fallout games. Conversations with NPCs now occur in real time rather than \"freezing\" time as in Oblivion. Players can craft, cook, or build any number of items depending on ingredients and skill levels.  Alchemy allows players to make potions, Enchanting allows players to imbue armor and items with magical abilities (such as increasing the effectiveness of magic resistance), and Smithing allows players to either craft or improve weapons and armor.  Smelting, tanning and cooking are also a part of this mix as well:  Smelting is the skill of turning raw mined mineral ores into usable ingots for smithing; Tanning is the process of drying animal hides to make leather strips, useful in creating or improving armor and weapons; Cooking allows players to turn otherwise minimally useful food ingredients into much more beneficial meals.  Melee attacks can be performed using either two or one-handed weapons. Blocking reduces damage and allows for the opportunity to bash an opponent with a shield. Archery is also available for some ranged attacks, as is quite a bit of magicka. Each race also has a distinct magic-like power ability; only one power may be equipped at a time. For instance, a Nord power is to frighten enemies away for a while. New to the series is the Shout ability, which is a special power based on Dragon language. These require a special set of circumstances to unlock: first, the ancient words must be learned from Word Walls hidden all over Skyrim; secondly, they can only be activated by acquiring a dragon soul (from slaying a dragon).  Crimes may be committed by stealing, pickpocketing, murder or attacking innocent people, or even by trespassing.  Generally this puts a bounty on the head of the player character, unless said character is quick enough to eliminate all witnesses.  Fines and jail time, or a beat-down from authorities, are likely to ensue if the hero commits too many crimes or merely ends up getting caught.  The protagonist can serve out his or her sentence on the jail bed, or pick the lock and escape; however, going to jail is likely to cause current skill progress to be lost.  As before, there are several groups, guilds, and the like that the player may encounter and join, each with their own advantages or disadvantages, each with their own views on the current events of the world, and each with their own quests. The abilities to become a werewolf or vampire are also present and have been somewhat streamlined: for instance, sunlight is not instantly deadly to vampires, and lycanthropy can be spread around.

Players point the Wii Remote to aim, B button to shoot and wiggle the remote to reload. The two main buttons are used to change weapons, and other actions such as throwing a grenade.The game is set before the events of the first episode and it takes place in the town of Bayou City. The well-known Agent G of the series is on his first mission this time, and he teams up with the Detective Washington to fight the plague of mutants, and who they thought to be at the head of this mess: Papa Caesar.The game, while still faithful to the spirit of the series, adopts very different tone, with the use of a vintage effect, popularised in the grindhouse movie direction. That way, the game goes over the top in different areas: violence, taunts, the scenario, all deliberately hinting at playing a B-game.There are three main modes are available: Story Mode, Director's Cut Mode and Mini-Games. Story Mode contains the classic rail-shooter concept, divided in nine levels. Director's Cut features the same levels but enhanced and generally longer. Mini-games are mostly shoot challenges for multiple players. By playing well or unlocking some achievements, the player wins money, which can be spent on upgrading weapons or buying new ones.The game still supports multiplayer for two players simultaneously. As a novelty, a player can carry up two different weapons.",

            "Description": "The Orient Express is about to depart from Paris to Constantinople. As the train slowly begins to move away from the station, a young, courageously looking man jumps on it from his motorcycle and makes his way inside. This man is an American doctor named Robert Cath, escaping from authorities as a suspect in the murder of a policeman. In the train, he finds the dead body of the person he was supposed to meet. Now he has to act quickly. The only way not to arise the suspicions of the police is to disguise himself as the murdered man. A very dangerous investigation begins, and the hero soon finds himself involved in a deep net of personal intrigues and political conspiracies.The Last Express is a real-time adventure game set in 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the World War, in a concrete historical and geographical environment. The game uses a simple point-and-click interface for interacting with people and objects, and navigating the character from a first-person perspective through pre-rendered backgrounds. From the moment the player gains control of Robert Cath, time begins to flow. If the player fails to solve a part of the mystery until the train arrives at the next station, certain events the player was supposed to prevent will occur, ending the game prematurely. It is impossible to permanently die in the game, as the player has the ability to rewind the clock in order to replay a specific period of time.The player is for the most part free to explore the train, and the story progression has a certain degree of non-linearity. Characters follow their own schedules, frequently moving between locations, talking to each other, and generally acting independently of the player's input. The player can decide to interrupt conversations, remain unnoticed, or openly follow characters and witness their activities. For example, at a certain moment in the game's timeline two characters will perform a classical sonata for violin and piano; the player can opt for staying and listening to the performance, or use the time to explore other locations. Along with detective work and a few inventory-based and logical puzzles, the player's main task in the game is to eavesdrop on people's conversations, talk to characters, and solve the mystery by finding out more information about the bizarre case. There are also several timing-oriented fighting sequences in the game.The game's visuals resemble \"art nouveau\" style that was prominent in the historical time period described in it. The similarity to the style is achieved by using rotoscoping technique. Actors wearing distinctive make-up and costumes were filmed against a bluescreen, digitized, turned into black-and-white frames and colored by hand. The game is also notable for including authentic dialogue recorded by native speakers of several languages (French, German, Russian and others), with English subtitles displayed.",

Concerned, that a new evil has appeared, the two set out to confront it at the temple. This is just the beginning of a new adventure that will take them Goemon and his partner all across Japan; into moutain villages, amusement parks, castle fortresses and more!Players control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages, enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.At the end of each village is an \"action area\" which changes the game in a complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center). These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player game, characters can ride piggy-back on one another, to avoid getting stuck by a scrolling screen.",

            "Description": "In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.The Legend of Zelda marks the first title of the Zelda series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If Link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. Some items function as weapons or armor, while others are used to solve puzzles. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece and gain a permanent health increase. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld (or the entrance to a dungeon), but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the player can choose to play the \"second quest\", which is essentially a harder version of the game. The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were advanced at the time: a continuous world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance the main character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.",

            "Description": "Recently, famine and drought have plagued Hyrule.  When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, Agahnim, appeared, and stopped these strange happenings from occurring.  But there is talk that Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, behind the scenes.  And then, one night, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for help - and the one who hears her pleas is a young lad named Link.The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a top-down action game with puzzle-solving elements (similar to the original Legend of Zelda). Players assume the role of Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda and save the land of Hyrule.  All combat in the game is action-oriented - the player can make the protagonist swing the sword at enemies with a press of a button, or spin the sword around for a more powerful attack by holding down the button until it is charged.Progression through the game is done by conquering a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own special item associated with it, such as the hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be used to flatten objects in your way).  Most of these dungeons are rendered impassable until the dungeon's particular item is acquired; from there, the rest of the dungeon becomes accessible due to Link's latest new ability.  The bosses of each dungeon are also themed to that level's particular item.Link starts out with only three units of health; however, these can be increased by defeating dungeon bosses, which give one additional heart container, or by finding four 'pieces of heart'; which can be given for anything from passing a small trial to winning a mini-game.  Some of Link's items also use magic - this can be refilled with collectible green magic pots.  After defeating the initial three dungeons, Link gains access to the Dark World - many puzzles and difficulties come from alternating between the Light World (Hyrule) and the Dark World to make his way past previously impassable obstacles.",

Eventually an adventurer appeared who was able to defeat Vaati. This adventurer carried with him the four sword which caused him to be split into four beings, and by working together the four beings were able to seal Vaati deep within the earth. But now Vaati has escaped, and the task of defeating him again has fallen to Link!This action adventure game is played from a top down point of view. There are a variety of often maze-like lands to explore (some above ground and others below) as well as a variety of enemies to defeat. Since Link is now in possession of the four sword, there are four Links on the screen. In order to complete the various stages, the four Links will often need to work together in order to solve puzzles and defeat the many enemies. The four links are able to form several different formations, such as a line or square. The formations help the Links perform actions that couldn't be done by one, like moving heavy objects or defeating numerous enemies. At the beginning of each stage, the four sword will be weak in power; to replenish the swords power, force gems must be collected (which can be found hidden in various locations or by defeating enemies). At the end of each stage is a dark magic barrier, and the only way to destroy it is by a four sword which has been completely restored. The game can be played by one to four players, however there will always be four links on the screen. In multi-player games each player will control one of the Links and will need to connect with a Game Boy Advance which is used both to control the game as well is provide each player with their own display when their Link is inside a house or in a cavern.In addition to the adventure mode, a multi-player battle mode is included where four Links fight to see who wins.

Link must do everything in his power to obtain the Triforce before Ganondorf does, and save Hyrule.Ocarina of Time is the first 3D installment of the Legend of Zelda series. Like most of its predecessors, it is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. Basic gameplay system is similar to the previous games, allowing Link to explore the world and complete dungeons to obtain key items and advance the plot. Sword combat as well as many familiar items such as boomerang, bombs, the series' currency (rupees) of various values, heart containers and their collectible fragments permanently increasing Link's health, etc., return in this installment. Link can now lock on enemies for melee and ranged combat, actively use a shield to deflect projectiles, as well as use various magic items. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games. Link can climb certain surfaces, dive underwater, as well as automatically jump.The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well. Each of them has certain unique abilities: for example, only adult Link can use bow and arrows, but only the child Link can crawl through narrow spaces. During the course of the game the player obtains the Ocarina of Time. Learning and playing melodies on that ocarina is needed to advance the plot, complete certain side quests, or travel in time, switching between the two versions of Link. It is also possible to befriend and ride a horse named Epona to facilitate travel between areas.",

Link, his friend Tetra and her gang of pirates are sailing unexplored seas when they come across a ghost ship. When Tetra wants to explore the ship she disappears and Link, who goes after her, falls into the sea and becomes stranded on an unknown island.While remaining true to the traditional Legend of Zelda formula, this game's controls are drastically different from other Zelda titles. This time you only use the touch screen to make Link move and attack instead of buttons. For example, swinging your sword is done with a short line horizontally or vertically in front of Link, or by tapping on a specific enemy. Link can somersault forward by having the player draw a small circle on the edge of the screen while running. The boomerang can be thrown in a specific path by drawing its exact route on the touch screen.You can also use the touch screen to make notes of secret treasures and items on the map simply by writing them down.  Sailing across the sea is also done by simply drawing the route on the map. While the route is being traveled, the player can pan the screen around to look out for enemies and other obstacles. The ship's route can also be changed while traveling if something else catches the player's attention. Later on, the player can even go fishing in the sea, using the stylus to pull the rod and reel in their catch.The game is presented in the same cel-shaded style as the Wind Waker but it is displayed from a classic top-down perspective.",

            "Description": "Apprentice engineer, Link, is ready to travel to Hyrule Castle and receive his engineer's license - and meet Princess Zelda herself!  However, during the ceremony, Zelda slips Link a note warning him not to trust the Chancellor, and to help her reach the Spirit Tower.  The land's Spirit Tracks (mystical railway tracks that cover the land) have been disappearing, and she suspects that the Chancellor is the cause.  While heading to the Tower, the Chancellor intercepts them, and proves Zelda's suspicions right - he casts a magic spell on her, splitting her body from her soul!  Link and Zelda must work together to return Zelda to normal and save Hyrule once again.In The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, the player takes on the role of Link.  As with the previous game, Phantom Hourglass, players guide Link entirely with the stylus - using it to move him, target foes, and guide special weapons.  The player is also encouraged to draw notes on the in-game maps - and in certain puzzles, it is crucial to do so.  Link receives new tools in the game as he progresses, including a windmill, which is used to blow away debris, poison gas, and enemies, and the pan flute, which is used to activate special tunes that unlock new areas, discover secrets, and more.  In certain dungeons, players will control both Link and Zelda, as they work together.  In her spirit form, Zelda is able to possess hulking Phantom suits of armour, which can be used to block flames, protect Link, and carry him across dangerous areas.As suggested by the title, the key method of transportation involves a train.  Players draw their route to the next area on the map, and then let the train run its course.  While the train is moving, they'll need to watch out for other trains, obstacles and animals on the tracks, and enemies.  They'll also need to keep an eye on the best track route, which they can change as they near a junction.",

Helpless to stop them, Link is asked by the king to meet with a race of tiny people known as the Minish, who may be able to help with their predicament.  On his travels, Link teams up with a talking cap called Ezlo, who is able to shrink Link to the size of a Minish so that he can meet with them.  With his newfound abilities, Link must save the kingdom from Vaati's menace.The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a top-down action adventure game that tells the origins of the evil Vaati from Four Swords.  Players take on the role of Link as they conquer various dungeons to retrieve essential tools to fight enemies and progress through various obstacles.  Items such as the Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt, while the Gust Jar can be used to suck in enemies, items, and propel Link.  Link can also shrink down to the size of a Minish with the aid of Ezlo, the talking cap.The Minish Cap uses the gameplay mechanic of shrinking to make familiar territory new and different.  Puddles become huge rivers, baby chicks are huge monsters, and regular enemies become deadly bosses at Minish size.  Link can also trade items called \"Kinstones\" with people in the game - when two pieces of the same Kinstone are joined together, new areas open up, treasure chests appear, and sometimes, even useful rewards are given to Link.",

On his tenth birthday, Link encounters a giant bird carrying a girl. Link rescues the girl, but as a result his own sister is taken away by the bird. The unknown girl is a pirate captain named Tetra, who agrees to help Link find and rescue his sister. During the course of their journey the two realize that a powerful, legendary evil is active again, and must find a way to stop him.The Wind Waker is the tenth installment in the Zelda series. Like its predecessors, it is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. Basic gameplay mechanics are similar to those found in Ocarina of Time: Link explored 3D outdoor areas and dungeons, fighting enemies and occasionally solving environmental puzzles. An addition to the combat system is the ability to parry at specific times, which is needed to overcome armored foes. Another new feature is picking up and using some of the weapons wielded by the enemies. Similarly to previous games, Link can use tools such as bow and arrow, boomerang, and bombs.Link needs to sail through the Great Sea in order to travel to other islands. He uses a baton called the Wind Waker to change wind direction by conducting it and producing melodies. The Wind Waker is also used for teleportation and puzzle-solving purposes. Link can use wind currents to glide and access remote areas. Visually, the game utilizes cel-shaded graphics to create a cartoon-like appearance. The characters' bodily proportions and facial features are not realistic, complementing the style. Link's big eyes, in particular, also have a gameplay-related function, giving clues to the player by looking at specific items needed to solve puzzles.",

At first Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village, Link's home town. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things sudden go wrong…The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks.The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, as a wolf Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. It can push blocks with its head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, it can attack enemies by biting or pouncing on them.As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before. Link performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves.The game's art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of The Wind Waker. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles and quite a few locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.",

The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted. ",

As in other games of its kind, constructions take some time but the player can spend tickets to speed things up. Tickets can be bought in the game and can also be used to unlock and build new rides and shops. To earn some extra cash the player can engage in different mini games that makes the rides go faster. These involves tapping or making sliding motions on the screen at a certain pace. To keep attracting visitors the rides need to be repaired and the shops need to be restocked. At the same time the player has to watch out for trash and empty the cans when they are full. Rides and shops can be upgraded and will then attract bigger crowds and make more money. A park grade shows how well the player is doing. By maintaining a high rank it is possible to get bonuses on earnings. One thing that has an impact on the grade is for example the cleanliness of the park. There is also a park rank that increases when the player levels up. To level up the player has to collect a certain amount of flags. Flags are earned from rides and shops in the same way as money as well as by doing tasks like emptying trash cans or restocking inventories. When reaching higher ranks, more buildings are unlocked.

The Movies gives you that opportunity by putting you in the shoes of an aspiring movie mogul starting in 1920s Hollywood. Hire directors and actors for your films, ensuring they get enough acting/directing practice to ensure they'll give their best performances. Be careful not to stress them too much though or next thing you'll know, they'll be drowning their sorrows with alcohol (or food). Don't forget to recruit builders, janitors, film crew, scientists, scriptwriters and personal assistants too, they're also just as important to ensuring the success of your studio. Once you've hired the actors, directors and ancillary staff you require to make movies, you'll also need to construct places for them to work and relax. A majority of your studio lot will be occupied by sets of one of five genres (Action, Sci-Fi, Horror, Romance and Comedy) which you can research and then build to be used for filming your movies. While your scriptwriters are making the final touches to that 5-star film script, you can get your directors and actors to practice their roles on the set. Eventually the script is complete and you must then decide which actors and directors would make the best fit for the film as the game takes into account not only how much experience the actors/directors have, but how good-looking they are (important for actors) and how well they get along with the rest of the crew. Filming then starts and it's your job to make sure that the actors and directors don't throw tantrums on the set or this could adversely affect the quality of the movie (not to mention prove expensive due to delays). Usually you would do so by making sure they pay a visit to the bar or restaurant beforehand (but don't make this too often or else they may get addicted and a visit to the Rehab Centre is in order)!When the last scene is finally shot, your movie is then ready to be released to the world! Keep an eye on movie critic reviews to gauge what can be improved next time you make a film if you want to ensure your studio isn't making B-grade movies indefinitely!",

Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.\n",

            "Description": "Deep in the Caribbean lies Melee Island, ruled by the governor Elaine Marley. The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar he meets three pirates who tell him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever. Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure out a way to foil the ghost pirate's plans.The Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in  Maniac Mansion: the player constructs commands for Guybrush by selecting an appropriate verb and then combining it with an object or an inventory item. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player places a cursor over them. The game is the first LucasArts adventure in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck; like in Loom, the player character also cannot die. The branching dialogue system, where the player chooses between several available responses during conversations, allows the player to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice, and is often used as a humorous device.The puzzles are predominantly inventory-based; most of the problems in the game are solved by picking up items and combining them with each other or with objects (or people) in the game world. Several tasks are dialogue-based; among those is the humorous \"insult swordfighting\", which involves Guybrush learning and choosing witty insults while dueling pirates. The CD DOS and FM Towns versions of the game have slightly updated interface (with graphically represented inventory items instead of the text-only labels in the original version), as well as CD audio music tracks.",

Your goal is to reach the gateway at the end of each map, usually hidden amidst the enemy lines. You must build military buildings to expand your borders that you can reach the resources that are initially out of your reach. Eventually reaching the gateway to proceed onto the next level. Your city needs roads to optimize the trade routes and allow different buildings to get the resources they need for production.The game is highly based on gathering resources and optimizing the roads to provide maximal resource gathering. In example, you need a woodcutter to provide a sawmill with logs in order for the builders to build new structures and harbors to build ships for your expeditions.The game is almost a 1:1 recreation of the original Settlers II game, but it adds few new things to the game such as new music and new GUI to support the stylus.",

            "Description": "This version of The Sims 2 is a downscaled game fit for cell phones. This version stays somewhat true to its big brother on the PC, while obviously limiting the amount of items and activities to work with the less powerful hardware.The game lets the player pick a \"Sim\" out of a list of premade ones, both male and female. The game starts with the Sim living in a small already-made house. Through using objects around the house as well as talking to other Sims who visit the player the Sim's skills will increase. They include: cooking, charisma, body, logic and creativity. Higher skills means that the Sim can do things better and get better jobs down the line.The Sim also has certain \"wants\" which the player needs to meet, such as buying a coffee maker or telling a dirty joke to another Sim. The more the Sim interacts with other Sims, the better friends they become. This can in the end lead to a relationship or even marriage with any of the 6 different computer controlled Sims.The money the Sim makes can be used to buy things for the house (such as a flat screen TV or a bathtub). These will not only make the house look nicer, but when used they raise the different needs bars much quicker. For example, buying a stove will make it easier for the Sim to eat than if he only owned a microwave oven. There are also extra rooms for the house which can be purchased, adding new activities and features for the Sim to partake in. Also, a constant drain of money is that every meal of food eaten costs a small amount of money.",

The camera controls use some more advanced touch screen gestures such as pinching for zooming.Mini-games for fishing and cooking have been changed from the PC to use the accelerometer as an input.

            "Description": "Based on the 1979 Paramount Pictures film of the same name and voiced by most of the original cast, The Warriors follows the career of a Coney Island street gang.  Starting months before the events of the film, The Warriors expand and defend their Coney Island turf, while proving that they are heavy enough players to join The Riffs’ network.  With a citywide rep, they can get invited to a major gang meeting where the future of New York street crime will be decided.  The game follows the nine lead members of The Warriors (with flashback missions showing how they came to The Warriors): leader Cleon, Swan, Ajax, Cowboy, Cochise, Snow, Fox, Rembrandt, and Vermin.  During the game, the player will control each member, usually acting as a war chief and leading a squad of Warriors on a mission.  Missions vary from simply wrecking another crew to completing a series of objectives while avoiding arrest or worse. During missions, players can mug pedestrians, steal car radios, commit smash and grabs, tag walls or bomb other gangs’ burners, and load up on flash.  Between each story based mission, The Warriors return to their Coney Island hangout where they can train to improve their stats, go out on patrol, review their accomplishments, replay levels, or enter into a series of quick-play combat matches.  The game plays like a squad-based brawler.  Each Warrior has his own fighting style and much of the game environment can be weaponized.  Fights are fast and often brutal, but stealth is also an option.  Players can perform stealthy finishing moves and distract police or other gang members with thrown bottles.  The game’s environments are fully 3D allowing Warriors to escape along the rooftops, hop over fences, or dash into shadowy areas.\n",

            "Description": "Based on the books by the Polish fantasy author Andrzej Sapkowski, The Witcher is an addition to the RPG genre from Europe, starring the main character from the books - Geralt of Rivia,  who is a \"witcher\" - a professional monster-slayer.The story begins when Geralt is found unconscious by his fellow witchers. He has lost most of his memories of the past, and joins other witchers when their fortress, Kaer Morhen, is attacked by members of a mysterious organization known as the Salamandra. Most of the enemies are defeated by the witchers, but the two most dangerous ones - a criminal nicknamed \"Professor\" and the sorcerer Azar Javed - escape after having gained access to the witchers' laboratories. The witchers part ways, and Geralt heads to the capital city Vizima, hoping to find more information about the assailants.The Witcher is a dark game with a dark world. War, murder, poverty, genocide, discrimination, torture, fanaticism - are just a few words that describe this setting. This is the world that the humans try to rule, and non-humans like elves and dwarves are subjected to suspicion and sometimes cruel treatment.  Will Geralt be a victim to a few sentimental moments of kindness, or will he survive as a cynical bitter murderer? These are the choices that you'll have to make.Using a heavily modified engine of  Neverwinter Nights, the game implements an original combat system, which requires the player to click on the enemy at the right moment in order to help Geralt execute combo attacks. In order to defeat the enemies efficiently, the player must observe the movements of the combatants, and choose the right combat style: \"quick\", which is recommended to use against fast enemies, \"heavy\", with lower precision, but more damage output, and \"group\", which is effective when Geralt is surrounded. In addition, Geralt often has to switch between his two basic weapons: the steel sword, which is used against regular enemies, and the silver sword, which is more helpful against supernatural creatures.Character growth is handled by allocating experience points into skills, teaching Geralt fighting styles as well as learning and improving his abilities. Alchemy is a skill that Geralt learns, allowing him to create his own potions, for healing purposes as well as for enhancing his witcher senses. Geralt can also learn and cast offensive and defensive magical spells.The Witcher requires the player to make ethical decisions for Geralt, which often have \"delayed consequences\" - for example, sparing a character's life early in the game will eventually trigger a scene much later, in which said character appears and helps Geralt in return for his kindness. As the game's plot advances, the player learns more about the social and political life of its world, and is able to choose his/her own path and alliances to different organizations and ideologies.",

Each day, players are given various missions to perform for the \"Reapers\" within a certain time limit, or be erased from existence.Players use collectible pins to amplify their combat powers against \"The Noise\", animal-like creatures which can corrupt the people and environment around them.  Each pin is activated in a different manner, from tapping the touchscreen, making sweeping motions with the stylus, or even blowing into the DS microphone. Neku fights on the lower screen of the DS, while his partner fights on the upper screen.  Their combat styles are different, but can be combined to form more powerful attacks.  Players can purchase clothing to increase the effectiveness of their attacks, and gain PP points to enhance their pin abilities.  PP is usually gained through combat, but can also be gained by coming into wi-fi contact with another person's DS.There is also a wi-fi mini-game called \"Ten Pin Slammer\", where players can use one pin at a time to knock the other players' pins off the game board.",

The Hammerite religion has crumbled and a new leader named Karras has risen up to convert many of these fanatics over to the mysterious Order of Mechanists. Meanwhile, a new Sheriff has arrived in town and has been effective at cleaning up crime - maybe too much so. This is bad news for Garrett, whose profession of master thief puts him on the wrong side of the law. As the risk increases however, so too does the amount of treasure available to a skilled thief.Thief II: The Metal Age keeps much of the same gameplay and abilities from the original Thief: The Dark Project, but also offers a few new items for the protagonist to use. Among them are scouting orbs, which can be thrown to see around corners and flash mines. The heart of the gameplay is still stealth, made up of Garrett's ability to stay quiet, stay hidden and keep signs of trouble out of anyone's view. Garrett's main weapons are his sword, his blackjack and an assortment of arrows, each with a special power. Each level features a variety of objectives as well as several items which don't belong to the protagonist, but are nonetheless valuable and can be stolen.",

            "Description": "Garrett, discovered on the streets as a beggar, is taken in and trained by the secretive organization known as the Keepers. However, Garrett's plans for his training is different than that of his masters and so Garrett soon parts company. Surfacing as a master thief, Garrett must enter forbidden places and appropriate the treasures of the rich and the powerful. Of course this line of work is offensive to many people including the rich nobles, the town guard and the religious order of the Hammerites. If Garrett can keep his head while he relieves these forces of their valuable trinkets, he should be able to do quite well....Thief: The Dark Project is a first person game focused on stealth. It is set in a metropolis called \"the City\", a medieval fantasy world with some elements from the industrial revolution era of technology. Garrett's main skills are in using the shadows to avoid being seen (the level of visibility indicated by a \"light gem\") and to avoid being heard (different surfaces make different noises). Guards can be alerted by either, and remaining hidden is ever important. Entering combat against armed opponents is not recommended, though some enemies (notably the various undead) can be taken on directly or avoided. It is also possible to silently sneak on guards, incapacitate them with the blackjack, steal their keys, and move their bodies.At Garrett's disposal is a wide range of equipment, including lockpicks, a blackjack, a sword, flash bombs, holy water, explosive mines, and a bow which fires normal arrows in addition to water, fire, moss, rope, and noisemaker arrows. Each type of arrows has a unique purpose: water extinguishes torches, moss covers the ground to soften the sounds of footsteps, ropes can be used to climb in certain spots or cross chasms, etc. The levels in the game are fairly open, and most of the time there are several paths and ways to accomplish the objective. Certain objects can be interacted with, moved from place to place, or destroyed. The game has three difficulty levels distinguished by the amount of goals needed to fulfill. Lower difficulty levels may allow the player to skip some of the harder areas due to the lack of a mission objective leading there. On higher difficulties, additional requirements (such as completely non-lethal way of finishing a stage) may be added. Loot gained from Garrett's thieving can be used to purchase additional equipment for the mission ahead.",

A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.Depending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.Like its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).The Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI \"bots\" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills. \n",

He soon discovers that the crystals he has found can power up a time machine. After having located traces of TimeSplitter activities in various time periods on the Earth, Cortez boards the time machine and travels to these periods, hoping to aid various characters in their battles against evil.TimeSplitters: Future Perfect is a first-person shooter in which players battle their way through thirteen story missions spread across six time periods, either alone or cooperatively. The protagonist's arsenal varies depending on the time period he travels to: for example, traveling to 1924 will allow Cortez to wield World War I weapons; a Soviet setting in the 1960's contains various local firearms of that time period; stages that take place in the future feature corresponding futuristic weaponry, etc. In addition to fast-paced shooting gameplay there are also some stealth and vehicle-driving segments.Like in the previous installments of the series, various multiplayer modes are included. Players can take on computer-controlled opponents on any of the fifteen arcade maps, or make their own ones. Players can also compete for awards in dozens of arcade league matches and challenges. It is possible to choose from between 150 characters and challenge other players to a head-to-head battle, either with up to four-player split screen or online and LAN play.",

            "Description": "The third game in the Top Spin series updates the concept of the previous two tennis titles with some new features. The most important change is that more control is given back to the player, levelling the difficulty. In the previous version the AI took control of timing and positing, players only needed to press a button for shots, and keeping it pressed longer made them harder. In this edition the player controls the power of the shot, the positioning of the player and the timing needed to perform a successful swing. When the player needs to run to reach the ball, it will never be as precise as powerful as when already in position. Most of these changes are gradually introduced in the tennis school, where players are trained to become familiar with the new controls.There are about twenty professional players, modelled after their real-like counterparts and with signature styles. Famous players such as Roger Federer and Justine Henin are present, along with a few legends such as Boris Becker, Björn Borg and Monica Seles. Not all legends are available at the same time for all three platforms (including Wii). An editor is included to design custom characters. There are dynamic weather changes and the players' costumes show traces of grass or dirt as the match progresses. In the same vein, the player faces show how they are sweating after playing for some time.Next to regular matches, there is a full career mode where the player starts with very low statistics. These can be upgraded by training and playing matches, but they can never all be pushed to the maximum. Instead players need to choose to train for some powerful abilities or decide to become a more all-round player. This is mostly reflected in the amount of winners based on forehands or backhands for instance.Along with quick matches, the world tour is also supported online. The world ranking starts over every fortnight and is not continued endlessly like the previous version. Some of the tournaments are the US Open, Australian Open en Roland Garros, but Wimbledon has not been included. There are various difficulty levels, six camera modes and the graphics are more detailed than the previous versions.",

Improvements over the last game include more detailed graphics and futuristic, high-tech backgrounds as completely new environment.The goal of the game is to race on fantastical tracks with ramps and unrealistically high jumps and reach the finish with as few crashes as possible. The game has a 2.5D environment, in that it is fully 3D modeled but players can only move on a single lane. Career is the main game mode with skill challenges for each tier as an extra challenge next to the regular tracks. Entirely new are level-specific challenges that can be completed for each track, for instance by restricting or forcing a certain riding style.The player can hit gas and break to move, and lean forward or backward to balance the bike. During long jumps player can perform mid-air stunts like back flips for bonus points. New to the series is the ability to perform free stunts in the air and the addition of quad bikes next to the regular motorcycles. In multiplayer mode, both offline and online, up to four players ride in individual lanes. When a player crashes or goes off screen they respawn in a position close to remaining players. The game contains a track editor to create custom courses in the Create mode, but unlike the previous game Trials Evolution it is no longer possible to create supercross courses. Tracks can be shared and downloaded through the in-game Track Central.",

            "Description": "When the king dies, there is no one to take the throne and the unspecified kingdom is left without a ruler. Soon, chaos ensues as the dead rise from their grave and take over the nation, driving everyone away. In this abandoned country, the lives of three characters become entwined. The thief Zoya make use of the situation to infiltrate the Astral Academy to steal riches. She discovers an artifact that glues her to the object, unable to move. Her fate is shared by Amadeus the wizard. Through an unfortunate experiment he was in a deep sleep and when he awakes he finds out everyone has left. As a light comes from a shrine in the academy, he discovers the thief and makes the same mistake. Finally there is Pontius the noble knight. More muscle than brains, he has bravely stayed behind to defend the academy, but he too, when discovering the duo, touches the object. The wizard recalls that the artifact is called The Trine, with the magical power to connect souls. Against their will, the three characters are now bound in their fate, their lives connected, and need to find a way to undo the powers. They explore the kingdom, looking for traces of the Guardian who is said to control the powers of The Trine.Trine is a physics-based action game where the strengths of each of the three characters need to be used cooperatively to complete puzzles and advance. When playing alone, the player can switch between any of the three characters at any time, but the game can also be played offline with three players simultaneously, each controlling one of the characters on the same screen, similar to the Lost Viking series. The game uses 2D-sidescrolling gameplay, but with many different layers in the front and the back that provide depth, and a camera that zooms dynamically. Each of the three characters has specific abilities. The thief is able to grapple wooden surfaces and uses bow and arrow to attack enemies, or fire arrows to light torches. The wizard uses his magic to move objects, and he is also able to create planks and crates. The knight is the blunt force, relying on his sword and shield to take care of enemy threats, and he is also able to lift and move heavy objects. The three characters constantly need to work together to get past obstacles and often there are multiple solutions. The environment is physics-based, with objects that can be stacked and swung, and breakable surfaces.There are also minor RPG elements to the game, as green potions provide experience. The characters can be leveled up for each of their three possible skills. Levels are also filled with hidden locations that often contain chests with items that enhance the characters' abilities. That way, they can resurrect, breathe underwater or get better resistance against damage. Levels contain multiple checkpoints. When one of the characters dies, it is possible to continue as the perished ones are revived at the next checkpoint. The characters can also collect health and blue potions that refill magic (drained by shooting fire arrows or using magic for instance). The focus is on puzzle solving and platform jumping, but there are many instances with different types of enemies such as skeletons, bats and boss characters, next to more general traps.",

            "Description": "Trine 2 is the sequel to the action puzzle platformer Trine. It once again stars three characters – Amadeus the wizard, Zoya the thief, and Pontius the knight – who need to work together and use their complimentary skills to progress through levels filled with enemies and physics-based puzzles. The game picks up the story when the trine is rediscovered and brings the three characters back together. It transports them to an unknown world where their progress is overlooked by a mysterious figure referred to as The Witch. Later in the game her true identity and purposes are revealed. The story further involves the Goblin King and his minions, as well as the tale of two sisters who are also princesses.Just like in the first game players can freely switch between the three characters to tackle the environment-based challenges. The knight is strong and most suited for close combat, the thief is agile and has long-ranged attacks, and the wizard is a feeble character that uses magic to manipulate items. Many of the original abilities are still present. The wizard creates boxes and planks as temporary platforms, the thief uses grapple to cross large gaps, and the knight is able to deflect projectiles with his shield. New abilities are unlocked through a skill tree shared by the characters, and some of the new options allow the wizard to chuck opponents around or for the thief to upgrade her arrows with new enhancements. Skill points are earned by locating vials. There is no longer an inventory with items gathered from treasure chests for additional upgrades. Instead the chests yield poetry that reveal bits of the story.The game can be played cooperatively with three players each controlling a character simultaneously. This can be done both offline and, new for this sequel, online. When a character dies, it can be revived at the next checkpoint. There are two new gameplay modes that are available right away. There is Game+ that allows players to go through the game again with their fully upgraded characters from the start. The second one is called Unlimited Character Mode and it allows players to assemble a party of any combination of characters, for instance using just three thieves. The game design always offers multiple approaches to over the challenges. The PC versions supports a 3D mode through NVIDIA 3D Vision.A later released update added a level editor to the Windows version.",

            "Description": "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is the sequel to Naughty Dog's 2007 game Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. The story picks up a few years where the first one left off, following the previous games fortune hunting hero, Nathan Drake, as he searches around the globe to try to solve another of the world's unsolved historical mysteries; this time regarding the famous merchant/explorer Marco Polo, who in 1292, mysteriously came back from a journey having lost 13 ships and 500+ passengers, with no explanation ever given on what had happened to those ships. After Drake gains knowledge of an ancient relic and a mysterious Himalayan Valley that may be connected to Marco Polo, he sets out on an adventure to discover the secrets of Polo's lost fleet, which he hopes will lead him to one of history's greatest undiscovered treasures.The gameplay of Uncharted 2 remains pretty similar to the first game. It consists of cover-based shoot-offs, fast-paced escape sequences and death-defying stunts fairly reminiscent of those of the Indiana Jones movies. Some notable changes include stealth-action segments in the game, which force you to move through certain areas hiding in cover from the hordes of pirates who await to kill you. The wall-climbing and cover mechanics have been heightened to a new extent, allowing free movement over walls and more items for Drake to use as protection. Drake spends most of the time alone, but during large parts of the game he is also accompanied by fellow treasure hunter Harry Flynn, Elena and Chloe where they are controlled by the computer. During certain sequences Drake needs to solve minor puzzles and the most complex ones require him to study notes in a book. Some of the locations visited include Turkey, Borneo and Nepal. Multiplayer modes are entirely new to the series. Among Thieves features both competitive and co-operative play, allowing you to play the game along with friends and people around the world. Competitive game modes include \"Deathmatch (Team Deathmatch)\", \"Plunder (Capture the Flag)\", \"Elimination\" and \"Chain Reaction\". Co-operative includes a mode called \"Gold Rush\", in which you along with two other people must work as a team to face off against waves of enemy AI as you guys try to capture treasures and return them back to your base. Each round does not only have more enemies, but they are a lot stronger too.Unlike in the original PS3 release, PS4 release features only the single-player mode, not the multiplayer mode. However, the PS4 release features a photo mode where you can pause the game and make the current screen look like a photo.",

            "Description": "Unreal Tournament 2004 is the third game in the popular Unreal Tournament series.This latest edition includes several new features.  First and foremost is the return of Assault mode from the original Unreal Tournament.  This mode pits two teams, attackers and defenders, against each other.  The attackers must try to complete various objectives, and the defenders have to stop them.  At the end of the round, whether time runs out or the attackers win, the roles are switched, and the defenders become the attackers.  A mode new to 2004 is Onslaught.  Another team-based mode, there are several Power Nodes spread throughout the map, with one base per team that houses a large Power Core.  The players must go to each Power Node, link it to the enemy Core, and eventually attack the enemy Power Core itself.  Rounding out the remainder of the game modes is the standard Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Double Domination, Bombing Run, Last Man Standing, Invasion, and Mutant, for a total of ten different game modes. An additional official game mode is Vehicle CTF, which will only appear in the gametype browser after the user adds a VCTF map in the Maps directory, be it an official VCTF map (released after the game was published) or releases from amateur mapmakers.There are several weapons available to you, all of which come with a secondary fire.  You have a shield gun, an assault rifle (which can be dual wielded if you pick up a second one after an enemy or ally dies while holding one, much like the Enforcer in the original Unreal Tournament), a shock rifle, Redeemer missile launchers (which can launch a missile guided by you), an AVRiL missile launcher, a lightning gun, a rocket launcher and a flak cannon, to name a few.2004 features, for the first time, vehicles, which are available in Onslaught, Assault and VCTF. You can hop into a tank (Goliath), a humvee (HellBender), a lightweight wheeled vehicle (called the Scorpion and relatively similar to the Warthog in Halo), a juggernaut vehicle (Leviathan) and several different hovering or flying vehicles, notably some space ships in some Assault maps such as AS-Mothership. Each vehicle has its own characteristics, some can hold multiple players and additionally some players can hitch a ride by standing on the external body of the vehicle. Some vehicles also have a personalized license plate with the name of the player driving it.There are over one hundred maps to choose from.  A lot of them are remakes from the past versions of the game, and there are several new ones made for 2004. Most maps for UT2003 are compatible with UT2004. Maps can be downloaded in the future, from official sources or from amateur mapmakers.Unreal Tournament 2004 also includes a detailed single player campaign, in which you earn credits by competing in tournaments, which you then use to draft a team to compete in team-based tournaments.  You work your way up qualifying ladders to the championship.2004 supports voice chat. It also includes the possibility to give a limited number of command through speech recognition. The game also supports text-to-speech, translation in-game text messages into voice messages using the computer default SAPI 4/ SAPI 5 synthesis voice.",

At that time, the Imperial Alliance invades the Atlantic Federation of the west. Their war will soon encompass all of Europa, including the peaceful nation of Gallia. While small in size, Gallia is known for their rich deposits of ragnite ore, a powerful source of fuel and medicine.  When the Galian town of  Bruhl is invaded by Imperial Forces, Welkin Gunther, his sister Isara, and friend Alicia Melchiott, take up the fight against their foreign conquerors, joining the Gallian Militia, in this WWII-style game.The player commands his forces through an overhead map, selecting units, and controlling them in a real-time 3rd person view. Taking on the enemy is done with a variety of units classes, including the Shocktrooper (basic soldier), Scout (excellent movement &amp; sight), Lancer (anti-tank), Engineer (repair, resupply, mine defusal, and more), and the deadly Sniper.This PS3-exclusive title features an art style best described as anime in watercolor.",

The race modes are single race, tournament, time trial, fastest lap and zones, where acceleration is automatic, and the single goal is to survive as long as possible without the ship breaking apart.Ships are controlled mainly by air brakes to achieve tight turns at high speeds. In certain race modes, players also have power-ups at their disposal, like weapons and speed boosts. It is possible to win a race by destroying the entire competition as well.

            "Description": "Like the other titles in the series, WipEout Pulse is a futuristic racing game where players control a hovercraft-like vehicle that hovers above the ground and can reach very high speeds. The game is set in 2207 where players take part in the FX400 Anti-Gravity Racing League with courses all over the world.The vehicles are divided over different teams (twelve including downloads), each with their own characteristics based on handling, speed, acceleration and more. While racing, moving over pads provides boosts or both offensive and defensive power-ups such as shields, rockets, a wall of fire, autopilot, a gun or a turbo boost. Instead of using weapons, they can now also be absorbed to restore the energy levels. A single button is used to accelerate, with regular steering and also air brakes for sharp corners. The visuals are very fast and the soundtrack consists of mostly electronic tracks, a hallmark of the series.The base game consists of twelve tracks, but these can be driven in both directions (designated by black or white in the title name). New to the track design are waterfall-like drops, loops and corkscrews. At certain section the vehicle is glued to the track to pass these. Entirely new to the series is the revamped progression system. As usual, new tracks and faster models need to be unlocked by winning races, but instead of a linear model these are now grouped as hexagon-clustered grids with different modes of play. When available, players can choose any of the sections to participate in a time trial, single race, head-to-head, eliminator games (returning from Wipeout 3) and Zone games (introduced in WipEout Fusion) where the vehicle constantly accelerates and transforms into faster models until all health is depleted. A certain amount of races need to be won to access a new grid, but using this system some difficult races can be avoided or ignored. In all races the vehicles are destroyed when all energy is depleted. Based on the performance a bronze, silver or gold medal is awarded and there are three difficulty settings.Using the vehicle of a certain team regularly is awarded with a loyalty system. The game supports game sharing and multiplayer modes using both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure as access. Up to 30 mp3 files can be loaded on a memory stick to use as the in-game soundtrack, there is photo mode to take screenshots during replays and on the game's official website players can design their own car skins using a flash client to use in the game. As with the previous games, there are many expansion packs that introduce new teams and tracks.",

The Soviet Union is crippled by economic issues and asks the United Nations to support the Communist society. Upon refusing, the Soviets assault NATO positions and open a second front in the United States to prevent the country from assisting Europe. The game has the player take command after the American invasion, but also in the events prior to it, set in Europe and Russia. The story is told through pre-rendered cut-scenes, stills, and in-game events.Like the developer's previous games in the Ground Control series, there is no resource or structure management. The player starts with a limited group of unit resources determined for each mission, based on 4 major roles: Armor, Air, Infantry and Support, each with different units. These include soldiers, tanks, jeeps, transport vehicles, helicopters, and more. Each unit has specific movement and attack options, along with two unique actions. The game is shown through a third-person perspective with full zooming options, rotation and camera control through the WASD keys, usually reserved for first-person shooters.The player controls a small group of units on a larger battlefield, with both AI-controlled enemies and allies. While playing, there are different objectives to fulfil and the commanders constantly provide updates from the battlefield. The gameplay is focused on the micromanagement of the available units. At the start of each mission, a limited amount of reinforcements is provided, which the player uses to assemble a team of units for the mission. Once a unit falls in battle, the reinforcement meter slowly regenerates to buy one or more new units. By controlling command points, fortifications are built automatically and these also provide other bonuses such as tactical aids.Tactical aids are the main form of support provided for your troops during the game. By completing objectives, the player can ask for air support at the cost of points, to launch napalm, air strikes, artillery fire, paratroopers and even a nuclear bomb. The setting heavily enforces to make good use of the environment, with small streets that slow down heavy tanks, buildings that can be captured by soldiers for more powerful attacks, and drop points selected through an overhead map. The environment is completely destructible.Multiplayer is focused on eSports with integrated voice chat, clan management, leaderboards and in-game avatars through the Massgate network. There is a focus on cooperative matches, with the players choosing one of the 4 available roles to create balanced teams. The game modes include Domination (push the domination bar in your team's direction by holding as many control points as long as possible), Assault (two consecutive rounds of defence and attack for command points) and Tug of War (fight for one long command point acting as a frontline, pushing it forward by controlling perimeter points). There is an additional mode called Few-Player mode where the game is tuned for 1-on-1 or 2-on-2 matches, removing the roles system and vastly increasing the reinforcement points.",

The main gameplay idea also remains the same - on-foot exploration of urban environments, hand-to-hand fighting, and role-playing elements, somewhat similar to the kind of gameplay that was introduced in  Shenmue games.

He discovers that the source of the Metatron is actually an abandoned battle robot, Jehuty (seen in the original Zone of the Enders), and decides to use the machine against the BAHRAM.Dingo soon realises that there's more to the story then simply wanting to own a powerful machine, as treachery and evil power comes into play. It's up to you to control the Jehuty and destroy any plans the BAHRAM for evil purposes, at whatever cost.Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner is a sequel to Zone of the Enders. Like its predecessor, it is an action game that concentrates on piloting the giant mecha Jehuty (walking or hovering in the air), engaging in battles against other robots, using his energy sword and secondary weapons and techniques. Unlike the first game, there is no \"world map\" to travel on; the player is taken to the next stage automatically. Jehuty can upgrade his abilities by destroying enemies and gathering experience. Sub-weapons are acquired after having successfully eliminated a boss enemy. The game also allows the player to participate in a battle against a friend in a two-player battle mode, or try out the special VR training missions.",
